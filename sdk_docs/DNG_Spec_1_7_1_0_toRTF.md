Preface

**About This Document**

The Digital Negative (DNG) Specification describes a non-proprietary file format for storing camera raw files that can be used by a wide range of hardware and software vendors.

This section contains information about this document, including how it is organized and where to go for additional information.

**Audience**

This document is intended for developers of hardware and software applications that will generate, process, manage, or archive camera raw files.

**How This Document Is Organized**

This document has the following sections:

[Chapter 1, âIntroductionâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark8%22) explains what digital negatives are, gives an overview of the DNG file format, and discusses the advantages of DNG.

[Chapter 2, âDNG Format Overviewâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark12%22) provides an overview of the DNG format, including information on file extensions, SubIFD trees, byte order, masked pixels, defective pixels, metadata, and proprietary data.

[Chapter 3, âRestrictions and Extensions to Existing TIFF Tagsâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark29%22) describes tag differences between DNG and the TIFF 6.0 format on which DNG is based.

[Chapter 4, âDNG Tagsâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark37%22) lists all DNG-specific tags and describes how they are used.

[Chapter 5, âMapping Raw Values to Linear Reference Valuesâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark164%22) specifies DNG's processing model for mapping stored raw sensor values into linear reference values.

[Chapter 6, âMapping Camera Color Space to CIE XYZ Spaceâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) describes DNG's processing model for mapping between the camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) and CIE XYZ coordinates.

[Chapter 7, âOpcode List Processingâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark180%22) describes the concept of âOpcode Listsâ, which allow additional

processing steps to be specified in an extensible manner.

[âAppendix A: Compatibility with Previous Versionsâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark195%22) documents compatibility between the current and previous DNG versions.

**New Information for Version 1.7.0.0**

The following changes have been made for the 1.7.0.0 version of this specification:

* A section on JPEG XL compression has been added to [Chapter 2, âDNG Format Overview.â](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark12%22)  
* The section on [Compression](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark33%22) has been updated in [Chapter 3, âRestrictions and Extensions to Existing](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark29%22)  
  [TIFF Tags.â](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark29%22)  
* [Additional tags were added to Chapter 4, âDNG Tagsâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark137%22) for Version 1.7.0.0.  
* The [ColorimetricReference](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark87%22) tag was updated with a new value for HDR output-referred images.  
* [âAppendix A: Compatibility with Previous Versionsâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark195%22) was updated.

**New Information for Version 1.7.1.0**

The following changes have been made for the 1.7.1.0 version of this specification:

* The [ColumnInterleaveFactor](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark160%22) tag was moved from version 1.7.0.0 to version 1.7.1.0.  
* [Additional tags were added to Chapter 4, âDNG Tagsâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark137%22) for Version 1.7.1.0.  
* [âAppendix A: Compatibility with Previous Versionsâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark195%22) was updated.

**Where to Go for More Information**

Introduction

**The Pros and Cons of Raw Data**

Seeking a greater degree of flexibility and artistic control, professional photographers increasingly opt to manipulate raw data from their digital cameras. Unlike JPEG and TIFF formats which store images that have been processed by the camera, camera raw files capture unprocessed or minimally processed data directly from the camera sensor. Because they are analogous to film negatives in a photographerâs workflow, camera raw formats are often referred to as âdigital negatives.â

Camera raw formats offer both advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is increased artistic control for the end user. The user can precisely adjust a range of parameters, including white balance, tone mapping, noise reduction, sharpening and others, to achieve a desired look.

One disadvantage is that unlike JPEG and TIFF files which are ready for immediate use, camera raw files must be processed before they can be used, typically through software provided by the camera manufacturer or through a converter like the Camera Raw plug-in for Adobe PhotoshopÂ® software.

The challenge for end users and camera vendors alike is that there is no publicly-documented and supported format for storing raw camera data. Every camera manufacturer that supports raw data must create their own proprietary format, along with software for converting the proprietary format into the standard JPEG and/or TIFF formats.

**A Standard Format**

The lack of a standard format for camera raw files creates additional work for camera manufacturers because they need to develop proprietary formats along with the software to process them. It also poses risks for end users. Camera raw formats vary from camera to camera, even those produced by the same manufacturer. It is not uncommon for a camera manufacturer to terminate support for a discontinued cameraâs raw format. This means users have no guarantee they will be able to open archived camera raw files in the future.

To address these problems, Adobe has defined a new non-proprietary format for camera raw files. The format, called Digital Negative or DNG, can be used by a wide range of hardware and software developers to provide a more flexible raw processing and archiving workflow. End users may also use DNG as an intermediate format for storing images that were originally captured using a proprietary camera raw format.

**The Advantages of DNG**

DNG has all the benefits of current camera raw formats; namely, increased flexibility and artistic control. In addition, DNG offers several new advantages over proprietary camera raw formats.

Self-Contained

With the current proprietary camera raw formats, software programs wishing to process camera raw files must have specific information about the camera that created the file. As new camera models are released, software manufacturers (and by extension users) must update their software to accommodate the new camera raw formats.

Because DNG metadata is publicly documented, software readers such as the Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw plug-in do not need camera-specific knowledge to decode and process files created by a camera that supports DNG. That means reduced software maintenance and a more self-contained solution for end users.

Archival

Camera manufacturers sometimes drop support for a propriety raw format a few years after a camera is discontinued. Without continued software support, users may not be able to access images stored in proprietary raw formats and the images may be lost forever. Since DNG is publicly documented, it is far more likely that raw images stored as DNG files will be readable by software in the distant future, making DNG a safer choice for archival.

TIFF Compatible

DNG is an extension of the TIFF 6.0 format, and is compatible with the TIFF-EP standard. It is possible (but not required) for a DNG file to simultaneously comply with both the Digital Negative specification and the TIFF-EP standard.

DNG Format Overview

This section describes the DNG format. As an extension of the TIFF 6.0 format, DNG should follow all the formatting rules for TIFF 6.0. For more information, refer to the TIFF 6.0 specification.

The following topics are discussed in this section:

* [File Extensions](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark13%22)  
* [SubIFD Trees](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark14%22)  
* [Byte Order](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark15%22)  
* [Masked Pixels](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark16%22)  
* [Defective Pixels](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark17%22)  
* [Metadata](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark18%22)  
* [Proprietary Data](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark19%22)  
* [Camera Profiles](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark20%22)  
* [Opcode Lists](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark21%22)  
* [Floating Point Image Data](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark22%22)  
* [Transparent Pixels](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark23%22)  
* [Proxy DNG Files](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark24%22)  
* [Depth Maps](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark25%22)  
* [Enhanced Image Data](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark26%22)

**File Extensions**

The recommended file extension for Digital Negative is ".DNG". Readers should accept either the ".DNG" or ".TIF" extensions for compatibility with TIFF-EP.

**SubIFD Trees**

DNG recommends the use of SubIFD trees, as described in the TIFF-EP specification. SubIFD chains are not supported.

The highest-resolution and quality IFD should use NewSubFileType equal to 0\. Reduced resolution (or quality) thumbnails or previews, if any, should use NewSubFileType equal to 1 (for a primary preview) or 10001.H (for an alternate preview).

DNG recommends, but does not require, that the first IFD contain a low-resolution thumbnail, as described in the TIFF-EP specification.

**Byte Order**

DNG readers are required to support either byte order, even for files from a particular camera model. Writers can write either byte order, whichever is easier and/or faster for the writer.

**Masked Pixels**

Most camera sensors measure the black encoding level using fully-masked pixels at the edges of the sensor. These pixels can either be trimmed before storing the image in DNG, or they can be included in the stored image. If the masked pixels are not trimmed, the area of the non- masked pixels must be specified using the ActiveArea tag.

The black encoding level information extracted from these masked pixels should be used to either pre- compensate the raw data stored in the file or they should be included in the file using the DNG tags for specifying the black level.

This black encoding level information is required even if the masked pixels are not trimmed, to allow DNG readers to process the image without requiring knowledge of the best way to compute the black levels for any given camera model.

**Defective Pixels**

There are two ways to deal with defective pixels in DNG. The first is to map out (interpolate over) the defective pixels before storing the raw data in DNG. The second is to include a bad pixel fixing opcode in the OpcodeList1 tag.

**Metadata**

Additional metadata may be embedded in DNG in the following ways:

* Using TIFF-EP or EXIF metadata tags  
* Using the IPTC metadata tag (33723)  
* Using the XMP metadata tag (700)

Note that TIFF-EP and EXIF use nearly the same metadata tag set, but TIFF-EP stores the tags in IFD 0, while EXIF store the tags in a separate IFD. Either location is allowed by DNG, but the EXIF location is preferred.

**Proprietary Data**

Camera manufacturers may want to include proprietary data in a raw file for use by their own raw converter. DNG allows proprietary data to be stored using private tags, private IFDs, and/or a private MakerNote.

It is recommended that manufacturers use the DNGPrivateData and MakerNoteSafety tags to ensure that programs that edit DNG files preserve this proprietary data. See [Chapter 4, âDNG Tagsâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark37%22) on page [24](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark37%22) for more information on the DNGPrivateData and MakerNoteSafety tags.

**Camera Profiles**

DNG 1.2.0.0 and later formalizes the concept of a âcamera profileâ and allows multiple camera profiles to be embedded in a single DNG file. A camera profile consists of a set of tags (both existing in DNG versions earlier than 1.2.0.0 and newly defined in DNG version 1.2.0.0), some of which are optional.

The set of tags belonging to a camera profile includes the following:

* BaselineExposureOffset  
* CalibrationIlluminant1  
* CalibrationIlluminant2  
* CalibrationIlluminant3â   
* ColorMatrix1  
* ColorMatrix2  
* ColorMatrix3â   
* DefaultBlackRender  
* ForwardMatrix1  
* ForwardMatrix2  
* ForwardMatrix3â   
* IlluminantData1â   
* IlluminantData2â   
* IlluminantData3â   
* ProfileCalibrationSignature  
* ProfileCopyright  
* ProfileDynamicRangeâ â   
* ProfileEmbedPolicy  
* ProfileGroupNameâ â   
* ProfileHueSatMapData1  
* ProfileHueSatMapData2  
* ProfileHueSatMapData3â   
* ProfileHueSatMapDims  
* ProfileHueSatMapEncoding  
* ProfileLookTableData  
* ProfileLookTableDims  
* ProfileLookTableEncoding  
* ProfileName  
* ProfileToneCurve  
* ReductionMatrix1  
* ReductionMatrix2  
* ReductionMatrix3â 

The primary camera profile is stored in IFD 0, as it was for DNG versions earlier than 1.2.0.0. This allows backward compatibility with older DNG readers. DNG allows additional camera profiles to be embedded using the ExtraCameraProfiles tag, which points to a list of Camera Profile IFDs.

â  Note that the profile tags describing a third illuminant (CalibrationIlluminant3, ColorMatrix3, ForwardMatrix3, ProfileHueSatMapData3, and ReductionMatrix3) and for specifying custom illuminant data (IlluminantData1, IlluminantData2, and IlluminantData3) are new to DNG 1.6.0.0.

â â  Note that the profile tags ProfileDynamicRange and ProfileGroupName are new to DNG 1.7.0.0. ProfileDynamicRange introduces the concept of High Dynamic Range camera profiles, where an encoding and decoding function need to be used to apply tone curves and lookup tables (which are usually defined on a normalized range \[0, 1\]) to overrange pixel values.

**Opcode Lists**

DNG 1.3.0.0 and later incorporates the concept of âOpcode Listsâ, which allow additional processing steps to

be specified in an extensible manner.

This allows complex processing to be moved off the camera hardware, which often has limited processing power, and into the DNG reader, which is often running on more powerful hardware.

This also allows processing steps to be specified, such as lens corrections, which ideally should be performed on the image data after it has been demosaiced, while still retaining the advantages of a raw mosaic data format.

The set of tags controlling this feature are:

* OpcodeList1  
* OpcodeList2  
* OpcodeList3

**Floating Point Image Data**

DNG 1.4.0.0 and later support floating point image data, in addition to the previous support for unsigned integer image data.

Floating point bit depths of 16, 24 and 32 bits per sample are supported.

**Transparent Pixels**

DNG 1.4.0.0 and later incorporates the concept of âTransparent Pixelsâ, which allow the level of transparency of pixels to be specified for the image data. This is useful when not all of the pixels in the image bounding rectangle are defined. For example, after combining several source images into a panorama, the edge of the resulting combined image is often not perfectly rectangular.

Transparency is supported by allowing masks to be stored in IFDs with the same width and length as the image IFDs, but with a NewSubFileType of 4 or 5 (see the section on NewSubFileType for details).

Fully transparent (undefined) pixels are stored with a mask value of zero. Fully opaque (defined) pixels are stored with a mask value of 1.0 for floating point masks, and the maximum possible unsigned integer for integer masks. Intermediate values are allowed for semi-transparent pixels.

For semi-transparent pixels, the image values should not be matted to either white or black, but instead stored with the same value as if the pixel was fully opaque.

**Proxy DNG Files**

DNG 1.4.0.0 adds the concept of proxy DNG files, which are lower resolution (and/or quality) versions of original DNG files. These proxy DNGs are useful files as placeholders for original DNGs in applications that have limited bandwidth or available storage space.

Proxy DNGs have information on the pixel size of the original DNG file to allow rendering parameters to be transferred back to the original DNGs with similar visual results.

The size of the corresponding original DNG file is specified using the OriginalDefaultFinalSize, OriginalBestQualitySize and OriginalCropSize tags.

Also added in DNG 1.4.0.0 and DNG 1.7.0.0 are new lossy compression options (JPEG and JPEG XL, respectively) that are particularity useful for proxy DNGs, greatly reducing their file size.

**Depth Maps**

DNG 1.5.0.0 and later incorporates the concept of âDepth Mapsâ, which allow estimated or measured depth

information to be specified for the image data.

Depth information is supported by allowing depth maps to be stored in IFDs with a NewSubFileType of 8 or 9 (see section on NewSubFileType for details).

The depth information IFD should use a PhotometricInterpretation of 51177 (see section on PhotometricInterpretation for details).

Depth information is stored as an 8 or 16-bit single channel unsigned integer image. Zero encodes the ânearest distanceâ (closest to the camera), and the maximum possible unsigned integer encodes the âfarthest distanceâ. The mapping of the depth map integer values to distance values is specified by the DepthFormat, DepthNear, DepthFar, DepthUnits, and DepthMeasureType tags.

The depth map should match the field of view of the main image. It may have a different pixel resolution than the main image, but if the depth map is resized to match the size of the main image, the pixels should correspond. The depth values should be filled in by an estimation algorithm for any areas of the depth map that cannot be measured directly (i.e. no holes are allowed in depth maps).

**Enhanced Image Data**

DNG 1.5.0.0 adds the concept of enhanced image data, which is a more processed (and always at least demosaiced) version of the raw image data.

Enhanced image data is stored in an IFD with a NewSubFileType of 16 (see section on NewSubFileType for details).

The enhanced image data should always use a PhotometricInterpretation of 34892 (LinearRaw). It should use the same color space as the raw image data.

The enhanced image data should use either 16-bit unsigned integer encoding, or 16 or 24 or 32-bit floating point encoding.

The enhanced image data is assumed to have already been mapped to linear reference values, with the exception that it may have a non-zero BlackLevel tag if unsigned integer encoding is used. This black level is required to be the same for all color planes of the enhanced image data.

The enhanced IFD may have its own copies of the BaselineSharpness, NoiseProfile, and NoiseReductionApplied tags, which may differ from the raw IFD versions of these tags due to sharpening or noise reduction having been applied to the enhanced image data.

The enhanced IFD should have a non-null EnhanceParams tag to document the operations used to enhance the image data.

**Semantic Masks**

DNG 1.6.0.0 and later supports the concept of "Semantic Masks" which may be used for purposes such as image segmentation.

Semantic information is supported by allowing semantic masks (images) to be stored in IFDs with a NewSubFileType of 65540 (10004.H). See section on NewSubFileType for details.

The semantic information IFD should use a PhotometricInterpretation of 52527 (CD2F.H). See section on PhotometricInterpretation for details.

Semantic information is stored as a single channel image with one of the following pixel data types, with valid encoding range indicated in parentheses:

* 8-bit unsigned integer (0 to 255\)  
* 16-bit unsigned integer (0 to 65535\)  
* 32-bit floating point (0.0 to 1.0)

The minimum encoding value (zero) represents "not a part of the semantic attribute." The maximum encoding value represents "is a part of the semantic attribute."

Encoding values in between the minimum and maximum values are allowed; they represent a partial semantic attribute. These fractional values may be used for matting or blending purposes.

A semantic mask should match the field of view of the main image, as specified by the ActiveArea tag. It may have a different (usually lower) pixel resolution than the main image.

Semantic masks may be stored uncompressed, or compressed with one of the following methods:

| Compression Method | Required Value for Compression Tag | Data Types Supported |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Lossless JPEG | 7 decimal (7.H) | 8-bit and 16-bit unsigned integer |
| Baseline DCT (lossy) JPEG | 34892 decimal (884C.H) | 8-bit unsigned integer |
| Deflate / Zip | 8 (8.H) | 8-bit and 16-bit unsigned int 32-bit float |
| JPEG XL | 52546 decimal (CD42.H) | 8-bit and 16-bit unsigned int 16-bit float |

Note that JPEG XL requires DNG 1.7.0.0 or later.

Multiple semantic masks may be stored in a DNG file. Each semantic mask IFD should include a SemanticName tag with a unique string that identifies the purpose of the mask. [See tag SemanticName for](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark140%22) [details.](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark140%22)

A semantic mask should have the same orientation as the main image.

1. **bit Format**

TIFF format was designed using 32-bit values to store file offsets, which limits the maximum size of a TIFF file to 4 gigabytes. There is a 64-bit extension of TIFF (known as BigTIFF) which does not have this file size limitation. The DNG format allows this same 64-bit extension. Note that 64-bit format support is independent of the DNG version.

The differences from 32-bit DNG to 64-bit DNG are:

1. The 16-bit value at file offset 2 is the constant 43 (instead of 42).  
   2. The 16-bit value at file offset 4 is the constant 8\.  
   3. The 16-bit value at file offset 6 is the constant 0\.  
   4. The 64-bit value at file offset 8 is the offset to the first image file directory.  
   5. The entry count for each image file directory is a 64-bit value (instead of 16).  
   6. The element count for an image file directory entry is a 64-bit value (instead of 32).  
   7. The data entry for each image file directory entry is a 64-bit value (instead of 32).  
   8. The offset to the next image file directory is a 64-bit value (instead of 32). Also, three new data types have been defined for image file directory entries:  
      * 16, which is an unsigned 64-bit integer.  
      * 17, which is a signed 64-bit integer.  
      * 18, which is a 64-bit file offset for an IFD.

It is recommended that DNG writers only use the 64-bit extension of DNG when the resulting file would be larger than 4 gigabytes to maximize compatibility with existing DNG readers.

Restrictions and Extensions to Existing TIFF Tags

This section describes the restrictions and extension to the following TIFF tags:

* [NewSubFileType](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark30%22)  
* [BitsPerSample](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark31%22)  
* [SampleFormat](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark32%22)  
* [Compression](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark33%22)  
* [Predictor](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark34%22)  
* [PhotometricInterpretation](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark35%22)  
* [Orientation](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark36%22)

**NewSubFileType**

In DNG versions earlier than 1.2.0.0, full resolution raw images should use NewSubFileType equal to 0\. Rendered previews or reduced resolution versions of raw images should use NewSubFileType equal to 1\. DNG 1.2.0.0 allows a new value for NewSubFileType equal to 10001.H.

This value, used for alternative or non-primary rendered previews, allows for multiple renderings (not just multiple sizes of a single rendering) to be stored in a DNG file. DNG reading software that displays a preview for a DNG file should, by default, display a preview from an IFD with NewSubFileType equal to 1\. Alternative renderings should only be displayed if requested by the user.

DNG 1.4.0.0 allows two new values for NewSubFileType. Transparency information for the full resolution raw image should use NewSubFileType equal to 4\. Transparency information for reduced resolution versions of raw images should use NewSubFileType equal to 5\.

DNG 1.5.0.0 allows three new values for NewSubFileType. Depth map information of the highest resolution should use NewSubFileType equal to 8\. Depth map information of lower resolutions should use a NewSubFileType of 9\. Enhanced image data should use a NewSubFileType equal to 16\.

DNG 1.6.0.0 allows a new value of NewSubFileType. Semantic mask information should use NewSubFileType equal to 65540 (10004.H). Multiple semantic masks can be stored in a DNG file.

**BitsPerSample**

Supported values are from 8 to 32 bits/sample. The depth must be the same for each sample if SamplesPerPixel is not equal to 1\. If BitsPerSample is not equal to 8 or 16 or 32, then the bits must be packed into bytes using the TIFF default FillOrder of 1 (big-endian), even if the TIFF file itself uses little-endian byte order.

**SampleFormat**

DNG versions earlier than 1.4.0.0 always use the default SampleFormat value of 1 (unsigned integer). DNG version 1.4.0.0 allows an additional SampleFormat value of 3 (IEEE floating point). The allowed BitsPerSample values for floating point images are 16, 24, and 32\.

**Compression**

Two Compression tag values are supported in DNG versions before 1.4.0.0:

* Value \= 1: Uncompressed data.  
* Value \= 7: JPEG compressed data, either baseline DCT JPEG, or lossless JPEG compression.

If PhotometricInterpretation \= 6 (YCbCr) and BitsPerSample \= 8/8/8, or if PhotometricInterpretation \= 1 (BlackIsZero) and BitsPerSample \= 8, then the JPEG variant must be baseline DCT JPEG.

Otherwise, the JPEG variant must be lossless Huffman JPEG. For lossless JPEG, the internal width/length/components in the JPEG stream are not required to match the strip or tile's width/length/components. Only the total sample counts need to match. It is common for CFA images to be encoded with a different width, length or component count to allow the JPEG compression predictors to work across like colors.

DNG Version 1.4.0.0 adds support for the following compression codes:

* Value \= 8: Deflate (ZIP)  
* Value \= 34892: Lossy JPEG

Deflate (8) compression is allowed for floating point image data, 32-bit integer image data, transparency mask data, and depth map data.

Lossy JPEG (34892) is allowed for IFDs that use 8-bit integer data and one of the following PhotometricInterpretation values:

* 34892 (LinearRaw)  
* 52527 (PhotometricMask)

This compression code is required to let the DNG reader know to use a lossy JPEG decoder rather than a lossless JPEG decoder for this combination of PhotometricInterpretation and BitsPerSample.

DNG Version 1.7.0.0 adds support for JPEG XL compression (see ISO/IEC 18181-1:2022):

* Value \= 52546: JPEG XL

JPEG XL compression is allowed for N-bit integer image data, where 8 â¤ N â¤ 16, and 16-bit floating point image data. The number of images planes must be either 1 or 3\. The PhotometricInterpretation must be one of the following values:

* 0 (WhiteIsZero)  
* 1 (BlackIsZero)  
* 2 (RGB)  
* 4 (TransparencyMask)  
* 32803 (ColorFilterArray)  
* 34892 (LinearRaw)  
* 51177 (Depth)  
* 52527 (PhotometricMask)

JPEG XL supports two types of bitstreams:

* A âbareâ format with no metadata  
* A âcontainerâ format that uses the ISO Base Media File Format box structure with optional metadata Both types of JPEG XL bitstreams are supported in DNG.

When using JPEG XL with multiple tiles, it is recommended to use the bare format, because each compressed tile will be slightly smaller, and per-tile metadata is not required.

When using JPEG XL to represent a preview IFD, such as a thumbnail or full-resolution rendered preview, it is recommended to use a single tile with the container format, so that utilities can extract a readable, standalone JPEG XL file by simply copying the bytes from the IFD.

**Predictor**

The following predictor codes are allowed for IFDs using compression code 8 (deflate):

* 1 \= Null Predictor. No predictor is used as part of the compression.  
* 2 \= Horizontal Difference. Documented in the TIFF 6.0 specification.  
* 3 \= Floating Point. Documented in âAdobe Photoshop TIFF Technical Note 3â.  
* 34892 \= Horizontal Difference X2. Same as Horizontal Difference except the pixel two to the left is used rather than the pixel one to the left.  
* 34893 \= Horizontal Difference X4. Same as Horizontal Difference except the pixel four to the left is used rather than the pixel one to the left.  
* 34894 \= Floating Point X2. Same as Floating Point except the pixel two to the left is used rather than the pixel one to the left.  
* 34895 \= Floating Point X4. Same as Floating Point except the pixel four to the left is used rather than the pixel one to the left.

**PhotometricInterpretation**

The following values are supported for thumbnail and preview IFDs only:

* 1 \= BlackIsZero. Assumed to be in a gamma 2.2 color space, unless otherwise specified using PreviewColorSpace tag.  
* 2 \= RGB. Assumed to be in the sRGB color space, unless otherwise specified using the PreviewColorSpace tag.  
* 6 \= YCbCr. Used for JPEG encoded preview images.

The following values are supported for the raw IFD, and are assumed to be the camera's native color space:

* 32803 \= CFA (Color Filter Array).  
* 34892 \= LinearRaw.

The CFA PhotometricInterpretation value is documented in the TIFF-EP specification. Its use requires the use of the CFARepeatPatternDim and CFAPattern tags in the same IFD. The origin of the repeating CFA pattern is the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle.

The LinearRaw PhotometricInterpretation value is intended for use by cameras that do not use color filter arrays, but instead capture all color components at each pixel. It can also be used for CFA data that has already been de-mosaiced.

The LinearRaw value can be used in reduced resolution IFDs and enhanced IFDs, even if the raw IFD uses the CFA PhotometricInterpretation value.

The following value is required for depth map IFDs:

* 51177 \= Depth

The following value is required for semantic mask IFDs:

* 52527 \= PhotometricMask

**Orientation**

Orientation is a required tag for DNG. With the Orientation tag present, file browsers can perform lossless rotation of DNG files by modifying a single byte of the file. DNG readers should support all possible orientations, including mirrored orientations. Note that the mirrored orientations are not allowed by the TIFF-EP specification, so writers should not use them if they want their files be compatible with both specifications.

DNG Tags

This section describes DNG-specific tags. Note that the tags listed here are not part of the TIFF-EP specification.

**DNGVersion**

Tag	50706 (C612.H)

Type	BYTE

Count	4

Value	See below

Default	Required tag

Usage	IFD 0

Description

This tag encodes the DNG four-tier version number. For files compliant with this version of the DNG specification (1.7 0.0), this tag should contain the bytes: 1, 7, 0, 0\.

**DNGBackwardVersion**

Tag	50707 (C613.H)

Type	BYTE

Count	4

Value	See below

Default	DNGVersion with the last two bytes set to zero Usage	IFD 0

Description

This tag specifies the oldest version of the Digital Negative specification for which a file is compatible. Readers should not attempt to read a file if this tag specifies a version number that is higher than the version number of the specification the reader was based on.

In addition to checking the version tags, readers should, for all tags, check the types, counts, and values, to verify it is able to correctly read the file.

For more information on compatibility with previous DNG versions, see [Appendix A: Compatibility with](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark195%22) [Previous Versions.](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark195%22)

**UniqueCameraModel**

Tag	50708 (C614.H)

Type	ASCII

Count	String length including null Value	Null-terminated string  
Default	Required tag

Usage	IFD 0

Description

UniqueCameraModel defines a unique, non-localized name for the camera model that created the image in the raw file. This name should include the manufacturer's name to avoid conflicts, and should not be localized, even if the camera name itself is localized for different markets (see LocalizedCameraModel).

This string may be used by reader software to index into per-model preferences and replacement profiles. Examples of unique model names are:

* "Canon EOS 300D"  
* "Fujifilm FinePix S2Pro"  
* "Kodak ProBack645"  
* "Minolta DiMAGE A1"  
* "Nikon D1X"

Tag	50712 (C618.H)

Type	SHORT

Count	N

Value	See below

Default	Identity table (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) Usage	Raw IFD  
Description

LinearizationTable describes a lookup table that maps stored values into linear values. This tag is typically used to increase compression ratios by storing the raw data in a non-linear, more visually uniform space with fewer total encoding levels.

If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.

See [Chapter 5, âMapping Raw Values to Linear Reference Valuesâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark164%22) on page [99](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark164%22) for details of the processing model.

Tag	50715 (C61B.H)

Type	SRATIONAL

Count	ActiveArea width

Value	See below

Default	All zeros

Usage	Raw IFD

Description

If the zero light encoding level is a function of the image column, this tag specifies the difference between the zero light encoding level for each column and the baseline zero light encoding level.

If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.

See [Chapter 5, âMapping Raw Values to Linear Reference Valuesâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark164%22) on page [99](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark164%22) for details of the processing model.

**BlackLevelDeltaV**

Type	SRATIONAL

Count	ActiveArea length

Value	See below

Default	All zeros

Usage	Raw IFD

Description

If the zero light encoding level is a function of the image column, this tag specifies the difference between the zero light encoding level for each row and the baseline zero light encoding level.

If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.

See [Chapter 5, âMapping Raw Values to Linear Reference Valuesâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark164%22) on page [99](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark164%22) for details of the processing model.

**WhiteLevel**

Tag	50717 (C61D.H)

Type	SHORT or LONG

Count	SamplesPerPixel

Value	See below Default	2BitsPerSample \- 1 Usage	Raw IFD  
Description

This tag specifies the fully saturated encoding level for the raw sample values. Saturation is caused either by the sensor itself becoming highly non-linear in response, or by the camera's analog to digital converter clipping.

The default value for this tag is 2BitsPerSample \- 1 for unsigned integer images, and 1.0 for floating point images.

See [Chapter 5, âMapping Raw Values to Linear Reference Valuesâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark164%22) on page [99](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark164%22) for details of the processing model.

**DefaultScale**

Tag	50718 (C61E.H)

Type	RATIONAL

Count	2

Value	DefaultScaleH, DefaultScaleV Default	1.0, 1.0

Usage	Raw IFD

Description

DefaultScale is required for cameras with non-square pixels. It specifies the default scale factors for each direction to convert the image to square pixels. Typically these factors are selected to approximately preserve total pixel count.

For CFA images that use CFALayout equal to 2, 3, 4, or 5, such as the Fujifilm SuperCCD, these two values should usually differ by a factor of 2.0.

**BestQualityScale**

Tag	50780 (C65C.H)

Type	RATIONAL

Count	1

Value	See below

Default	1.0

Usage	Raw IFD

Description

For some cameras, the best possible image quality is not achieved by preserving the total pixel count during conversion. For example, Fujifilm SuperCCD images have maximum detail when their total pixel count is doubled.

This tag specifies the amount by which the values of the DefaultScale tag need to be multiplied to achieve the best quality image size.

**DefaultCropOrigin**

Tag	50719 (C61F.H)

Type	SHORT or LONG or RATIONAL

Count	2

Value	DefaultCropOriginH, DefaultCropOriginV Default	0, 0

Usage	Raw IFD

Description

Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image.

DefaultCropOrigin specifies the origin of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied), relative to the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle.

**DefaultCropSize**

Tag	50720 (C620.H)

Type	SHORT or LONG or RATIONAL

Count	2

Value	DefaultCropSizeH, DefaultCropSizeV Default	ImageWidth, ImageLength

Usage	Raw IFD

Description

Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image.

DefaultCropSize specifies the size of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied).

**CalibrationIlluminant1**

Tag	50778 (C65A.H)

Type	SHORT

Count	1

Value	See below

Default	0 (unknown)

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

The illuminant used for the first set of color calibration tags. The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the LightSource EXIF tag.

Starting with DNG 1.6.0.0, the value may be set to 255 (Other) to indicate a custom illuminant. If set to 255, then the IFD must also include a IlluminantData1 tag to specify the x-y chromaticity or spectral power distribution function for this illuminant.

See [Chapter 6, âMapping Camera Color Space to CIE XYZ Spaceâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) on page [100](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) for details of the color- processing model.

**CalibrationIlluminant2**

Tag	50779 (C65B.H)

Type	SHORT

Count	1

Value	See below

Default	None

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

The illuminant used for an optional second set of color calibration tags. The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the CalibrationIlluminant1 tag; however, if both are included, neither is allowed to have a value of 0 (unknown).

Starting with DNG 1.6.0.0, the value may be set to 255 (Other) to indicate a custom illuminant. If set to 255, then the IFD must also include a IlluminantData2 tag to specify the x-y chromaticity or spectral power distribution function for this illuminant.

See [Chapter 6, âMapping Camera Color Space to CIE XYZ Spaceâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) on page [100](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) for details of the color- processing model.

**ColorMatrix1**

Tag	50721 (C621.H)

Type	SRATIONAL

Count	ColorPlanes \* 3

Value	See below

Default	None

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

ColorMatrix1 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order.

The ColorMatrix1 tag is required for all non-monochrome DNG files.

See [Chapter 6, âMapping Camera Color Space to CIE XYZ Spaceâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) on page [100](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) for details of the color- processing model.

**ColorMatrix2**

Tag	50722 (C622.H)

Type	SRATIONAL

Count	ColorPlanes \* 3

Value	See below

Default	None

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

ColorMatrix2 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order.

See [Chapter 6, âMapping Camera Color Space to CIE XYZ Spaceâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) on page [100](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) for details of the color- processing model.

**CameraCalibration1**

Tag	50723 (C623.H)

Type	SRATIONAL

Count	ColorPlanes \* ColorPlanes Value	See below  
Default	Identity matrix Usage	IFD 0  
Description

CameraCalibration1 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order.

This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix1 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.

See [Chapter 6, âMapping Camera Color Space to CIE XYZ Spaceâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) on page [100](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) for details of the color- processing model.

**CameraCalibration2**

Tag	50724 (C624.H)

Type	SRATIONAL

Count	ColorPlanes \* ColorPlanes Value	See below  
Default	Identity matrix Usage	IFD 0  
Description

CameraCalibration2 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order.

This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix2 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.

See [Chapter 6, âMapping Camera Color Space to CIE XYZ Spaceâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) on page [100](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) for details of the color- processing model.

**ReductionMatrix1**

Tag	50725 (C625.H)

Type	SRATIONAL

Count	3 \* ColorPlanes

Value	See below

Default	None

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

ReductionMatrix1 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the first calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3\. The matrix is stored in row scan order.

See [Chapter 6, âMapping Camera Color Space to CIE XYZ Spaceâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) on page [100](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) for details of the color- processing model.

**ReductionMatrix2**

Tag	50726 (C626.H)

Type	SRATIONAL

Count	3 \* ColorPlanes

Value	See below

Default	None

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

ReductionMatrix2 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the second calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3\. The matrix is stored in row scan order.

See [Chapter 6, âMapping Camera Color Space to CIE XYZ Spaceâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) on page [100](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) for details of the color- processing model.

**AnalogBalance**

Tag	50727 (C627.H)

Type	RATIONAL

Count	ColorPlanes

Value	See below

Default	All 1.0

Usage	IFD 0

Description

Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image.

AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values.

See [Chapter 6, âMapping Camera Color Space to CIE XYZ Spaceâ](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) on page [100](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark169%22) for details of the color- processing model.

**AsShotNeutral**

Tag	50728 (C628.H)

Type	SHORT or RATIONAL

Count	ColorPlanes

Value	See below

Default	None

Usage	IFD 0

Description

AsShotNeutral specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as the coordinates of a perfectly neutral color in linear reference space values. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotWhiteXY tag.

**AsShotWhiteXY**

Tag	50729 (C629.H)

Type	RATIONAL

Count	2

Value	See below

Default	None

Usage	IFD 0

Description

AsShotWhiteXY specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as x-y chromaticity coordinates. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotNeutral tag.

**BaselineExposure**

Tag	50730 (C62A.H)

Type	SRATIONAL

Count	1

Value	See below

Default   0.0

Usage	IFD 0

Description

Camera models vary in the tradeoff they make between highlight headroom and shadow noise. Some leave a significant amount of highlight headroom during a normal exposure. This allows significant negative exposure compensation to be applied during raw conversion, but also means normal exposures will contain more

shadow noise. Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures.

Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results.

**BaselineNoise**

Tag	50731 (C62B.H)

Type	RATIONAL

Count	1

Value	See below

Default	1.0

Usage	IFD 0

Description

BaselineNoise specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model.

Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image.

It is recommended that cameras use the newer [NoiseProfile tag](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark118%22) instead.

**BaselineSharpness**

Tag	50732 (C62C.H)

Type	RATIONAL

Count	1

Value	See below

Default	1.0

Usage	IFD 0 or Enhanced IFD

Description

BaselineSharpness specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti- aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters.

**BayerGreenSplit**

Tag	50733 (C62D.H)

Type	LONG

Count	1

Value	See below

Default	0

Usage	Raw IFD

Description

BayerGreenSplit only applies to CFA images using a Bayer pattern filter array. This tag specifies, in arbitrary units, how closely the values of the green pixels in the blue/green rows track the values of the green pixels in the red/green rows.

A value of zero means the two kinds of green pixels track closely, while a non-zero value means they sometimes diverge. The useful range for this tag is from 0 (no divergence) to about 5000 (quite large divergence).

**LinearResponseLimit**

Tag	50734 (C62E.H)

Type	RATIONAL

Count	1

Value	See below

Default	1.0

Usage	IFD 0

Description

Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect.

LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.

**CameraSerialNumber**

Tag	50735 (C62F.H)

Type	ASCII

Count	String length including null Value	Null-terminated string  
Default	None

Usage	IFD 0

Description

CameraSerialNumber contains the serial number of the camera or camera body that captured the image.

**LensInfo**

Tag	50736 (C630.H)

Type	RATIONAL

Count	4

Value	Value 0: Minimum focal length in mm. Value 1: Maximum focal length in mm.  
Value 2: Minimum f-stop (maximum aperture) at minimum focal length. Value 3: Minimum f-stop (maximum aperture) at maximum focal length.  
Default	None

Usage	IFD 0

Description

LensInfo contains information about the lens that captured the image. If the minimum f-stops are unknown, they should be encoded as 0/0.

**ChromaBlurRadius**

Tag	50737 (C631.H)

Type	RATIONAL

Count	1

Value	Chroma blur radius in pixels Default	See below

Usage	Raw IFD

Description

ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring.

Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm.

**AntiAliasStrength**

Tag	50738 (C632.H)

Type	RATIONAL

Count	1

Value	Relative strength of the cameraâs anti-alias filter Default	1.0  
Usage	Raw IFD

Description

AntiAliasStrength provides a hint to the DNG reader about how strong the camera's anti-alias filter is. A value of 0.0 means no anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera is prone to aliasing artifacts with some subjects), while a value of 1.0 means a strong anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera almost never has aliasing artifacts).

Note that this tag overlaps in functionality with the BaselineSharpness tag. The primary difference is the AntiAliasStrength tag is used as a hint to the de-mosaic algorithm, while the BaselineSharpness tag is used as a hint to a sharpening algorithm applied later in the processing pipeline.

**ShadowScale**

Tag	50739 (C633.H)

Type	RATIONAL

Count	1

Value	See below

Default	1.0

Usage	IFD 0

Description

This tag is used by older versions of Adobe Camera Raw to control the sensitivity of its "Blacks" slider.

**DNGPrivateData**

Tag	50740 (C634.H)

Type	BYTE

Count	Length of private data block in bytes Value	See below  
Default	None

Usage	IFD 0

Description

This tag provides a way for camera manufacturers to store private data in the DNG file for use by their own raw converters, and to have that data preserved by programs that edit DNG files.

The private data must follow these rules:

* *The private data must start with a null-terminated ASCII string identifying the data*. The first part of this string must be the manufacturer's name, to avoid conflicts between manufacturers.  
* *The private data must be self-contained*. All offsets within the private data must be offsets relative to the start of the private data, and they must not point to bytes outside the private data.  
* *The private data must be byte-order independent*. If a DNG file is converted from a big- endian file to a little-endian file, the data must remain valid.

**MakerNoteSafety**

Tag	50741 (C635.H)

Type	SHORT

Count	1

Value	0 (unsafe) or 1 (safe)

Default	0

Usage	IFD 0

Description

MakerNoteSafety lets the DNG reader know whether the EXIF MakerNote tag is safe to preserve along with the rest of the EXIF data. File browsers and other image management software processing an image with a preserved MakerNote should be aware that any thumbnail image embedded in the MakerNote may be stale and may not reflect the current state of the full-size image.

A MakerNote is safe to preserve if it follows these rules:

* *The MakerNote data must be self-contained.* All offsets within the MakerNote must be offsets relative to the start of the MakerNote, and they must not point to bytes outside the MakerNote.  
* *The MakerNote data must be byte-order independent.* Moving the data to a file with a different byte order must not invalidate it.

**RawDataUniqueID**

Tag	50781 (C65D.H)

Type	BYTE

Count	16

Value	See below

Default   Optional

Usage	IFD 0

Description

This tag contains a 16-byte unique identifier for the raw image data in the DNG file. DNG readers can use this tag to recognize a particular raw image, even if the file's name or the metadata contained in the file has been changed.

If a DNG writer creates such an identifier, it should do so using an algorithm that will ensure that it is very unlikely two different images will end up having the same identifier.

**OriginalRawFileName**

Tag	50827 (C68B.H)

Type	ASCII or BYTE

Count	Byte count including null

Value	Null-terminated UTF-8 encoded Unicode string Default	Optional

Usage	IFD 0

Description

If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the file name of that original raw file.

**OriginalRawFileData**

Tag	50828 (C68C.H)

Type	UNDEFINED

Count	Byte count of embedded data Value	See below

Default   Optional

Usage	IFD 0

Description

If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the compressed contents of that original raw file.

The contents of this tag always use the big-endian byte order.

The tag contains a sequence of data blocks. Future versions of the DNG specification may define additional data blocks, so DNG readers should ignore extra bytes when parsing this tag. DNG readers should also detect the case where data blocks are missing from the end of the sequence and should assume a default value for all the missing blocks.

There are no padding or alignment bytes between data blocks. The sequence of data blocks is:

1. Compressed data fork of original raw file.  
2. Compressed macOS resource fork of original raw file.  
3. macOS file type (4 bytes) of original raw file.  
4. macOS file creator (4 bytes) of original raw file.  
5. Compressed data fork of sidecar ".THM" file.  
6. Compressed macOS resource fork of sidecar ".THM" file.  
7. macOS file type (4 bytes) of sidecar ".THM" file.  
8. macOS file creator (4 bytes) of sidecar ".THM" file.

If the macOS file types or creator codes are unknown, zero is stored.

If the macOS resource forks do not exist, they should be encoded as zero-length forks. Each fork (data or macOS resource) is compressed and encoded as:

ForkLength \= first four bytes. This is the uncompressed length of this fork. If this value is zero, then no more data is stored for this fork.

From ForkLength, compute the number of 64K compression blocks used for this data (the last block is usually smaller than 64K):

ForkBlocks \= Floor ((ForkLength \+ 65535\) / 65536\)

The next (ForkBlocks \+ 1\) 4-byte values are an index into the compressed data. The first ForkBlock values are offsets from the start of the data for this fork to the start of the compressed data for the corresponding compression block. The last value is an offset from the start of the data for this fork to the end of the data for this fork.

Following this index is the ZIP compressed data for each 64K compression block.

**ActiveArea**

Tag	50829 (C68D.H)

Type	SHORT or LONG

Count	4

Value	See below

Default	0, 0, ImageLength, ImageWidth Usage	Raw IFD  
Description

This rectangle defines the active (non-masked) pixels of the sensor. The order of the rectangle coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right.

**MaskedAreas**

Tag	50830 (C68E.H)

Type	SHORT or LONG

Count	4 \* number of rectangles Value	See below  
Default	None

Usage	Raw IFD

Description

This tag contains a list of non-overlapping rectangle coordinates of fully masked pixels, which can be optionally used by DNG readers to measure the black encoding level.

The order of each rectangle's coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right.

If the raw image data has already had its black encoding level subtracted, then this tag should not be used, since the masked pixels are no longer useful.

Note that DNG writers are still required to include estimate and store the black encoding level using the black level DNG tags. Support for the MaskedAreas tag is not required of DNG readers.

**AsShotICCProfile**

Tag	50831 (C68F.H)

Type	UNDEFINED

Count	Length of ICC profile in bytes Value	See below  
Default	Optional

Usage	IFD 0

Description

This tag contains an ICC profile that, in conjunction with the AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag, provides the camera manufacturer with a way to specify a default color rendering from camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) into the ICC profile connection space.

The ICC profile connection space is an output referred colorimetric space, whereas the other color calibration tags in DNG specify a conversion into a scene referred colorimetric space. This means that the rendering in this profile should include any desired tone and gamut mapping needed to convert between scene referred values and output referred values.

DNG readers that have their own tone and gamut mapping controls (such as Adobe Camera Raw) will probably ignore this tag pair.

**AsShotPreProfileMatrix**

Tag	50832 (C690.H)

Type	SRATIONAL

Count	3 \* ColorPlanes or ColorPlanes \* ColorPlanes

Value	See below Default	Identity matrix Usage	IFD 0  
Description

This tag is used in conjunction with the AsShotICCProfile tag. It specifies a matrix that should be applied to the camera color space coordinates before processing the values through the ICC profile specified in the AsShotICCProfile tag.

The matrix is stored in the row scan order.

If ColorPlanes is greater than three, then this matrix can (but is not required to) reduce the dimensionality of the color data down to three components, in which case the AsShotICCProfile should have three rather than ColorPlanes input components.

**CurrentICCProfile**

Tag	50833 (C691.H)

Type	UNDEFINED

Count	Length of ICC profile in bytes Value	See below  
Default	Optional

Usage	IFD 0

Description

This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentPreProfileMatrix tag.

The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.

**CurrentPreProfileMatrix**

Tag	50834 (C692.H)

Type	SRATIONAL

Count	3 \* ColorPlanes or ColorPlanes \* ColorPlanes

Value	See below Default	Identity matrix Usage	IFD 0  
Description

This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentICCProfile tag.

The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.

**Additional Tags for Version 1.2.0.0**

The following tags have been added for the 1.2.0.0 version of this specification.

**ColorimetricReference**

Description

The DNG color model documents a transform between camera colors and CIE XYZ values. This tag describes the colorimetric reference for the CIE XYZ values.

* 0 \= The XYZ values are scene-referred.  
* 1 \= The XYZ values are output-referred, using the ICC profile perceptual dynamic range.  
* 2 \= The XYZ values are output-referred and may be high dynamic range. XYZ coordinates may be less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0.

Values 1 and 2 allow output-referred data to be stored in DNG files and still processed correctly by DNG readers.

Values 0 and 1 are supported in DNG version 1.2 and later. Value 2 is supported in DNG version 1.7 and later.

* HueDivisions \>= 1  
* SaturationDivisions \>= 2  
* ValueDivisions \>=1

The most common case has ValueDivisions equal to 1, so only hue and saturation are used as inputs to the mapping table.

**ProfileToneCurve**

Tag	50940 (C6FC.H)

Type	FLOAT

Count	Samples \* 2

Value	See below

Default	None

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

This tag contains a default tone curve that can be applied while processing the image as a starting point for user adjustments. The curve is specified as a list of 32-bit IEEE floating- point value pairs in linear gamma. Each sample is a pair (x,y) where x is the input value in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 and y is the output value in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. Samples must be stored in ascending order of x coordinates, and each sample must have an x coordinate that is greater than the previous sample (strictly increasing).

DNG readers should interpolate the curve using a cubic spline.

For Standard Dynamic Range camera profiles, the first sample is required to be (0.0, 0.0), and the last sample is required to be (1.0, 1.0).

For High Dynamic Range camera profiles, the first sample is required to be (0.0, 0.0). The curve is applied in an encoded space (instead of linear gamma) to accommodate overrange pixel values. [See the description of](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark157%22) [ProfileDynamicRange for details.](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark157%22) Readers should process pixel values beyond (greater than) the curveâs final point by using slope extension; that is, the affine function that passes through the curveâs final point and matches the curveâs slope at that point.

**ProfileEmbedPolicy**

Tag	50941 (C6FD.H)

Type	LONG

Count	1

Value	See below

Default	0

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

This tag contains information about the usage rules for the associated camera profile. The valid values and meanings are:

* 0 \= âallow copyingâ. The camera profile can be used to process, or be embedded in, any DNG file. It can be copied from DNG files to other DNG files or copied from DNG files and stored on the userâs system for use in processing or embedding in any DNG file. The camera profile may not be used to process non-DNG files.  
* 1 \= âembed if usedâ. This value applies the same rules as âallow copyingâ, except it does not allow copying the camera profile from a DNG file for use in processing any image other than the image in which it is embedded, unless the profile is already stored on the userâs system.  
* 2 \= âembed neverâ. This value only applies to profiles stored on a userâs system but not already embedded in DNG files. These stored profiles can be used to process images but cannot be embedded in files. If a camera profile is already embedded in a DNG file, then this value has the same restrictions as âembed if usedâ.  
* 3 \= âno restrictionsâ. The camera profile creator has not placed any restrictions on the use of the  
  camera profile.

**NoiseProfile**

Tag	51041 (C761.H)

Type	DOUBLE

Count	2 or 2 \* ColorPlanes

Value	See below

Default	Values are estimated from BaselineNoise tag (see below) Usage	Raw IFD or Enhanced IFD  
Description

NoiseProfile describes the amount of noise in a raw image. Specifically, this tag models the amount of signal- dependent photon (shot) noise and signal-independent sensor readout noise, two common sources of noise in raw images. The model assumes that the noise is white and spatially independent, ignoring fixed pattern effects and other sources of noise (e.g., pixel response non-uniformity, spatially-dependent thermal effects, etc.).

This tag is intended to be used to describe the amount of noise present in unprocessed raw image data. When noise reduction has already been applied to the raw data (i.e., NoiseReductionApplied \> 0 ), this tag may be used to estimate the white component of the residual noise.

For the purposes of this tag, noise is defined as the standard deviation of a random variable ð¥, where ð¥

represents a recorded linear signal in the range ð¥ â \[0,1\]. The two-parameter noise model is:

ðð(ð¥) \= âððð¥ \+ ðð

For parameters (ðð, ðð), where ðð is a scale term that models the amount of sensor amplification, and ðð is an offset term that models the amount of sensor readout noise. A more detailed explanation of this model is given below.

The data elements for this tag are the ð sets of noise model parameters:

ð1, ð1, ð2, ð2, â¦ , ðð, ðð

Note that ð must be 1 (i.e., tag count is 2\) or equal to the number of color planes in the image (i.e., tag count is 2 Ã ColorPlanes). When n \= 1, the two specified parameters (ð1, ð1) define the same noise model for all

image planes. When ð is equal to the number of image planes, the parameters (ðð, ðð) define the noise model for the ðth image plane, e.g., (ð1, ð1) correspond to the first image plane, (ð2, ð2) correspond to the

second image plane, etc. The order of the parameters follows the plane order specified by the CFAPlaneColor tag.

Each ðð term must be positive (ðð \> 0\), and each ðð term must be non-negative (ðð Â³ 0\).

A BaselineNoise tag value of 1.0 at ISO 100 corresponds approximately to NoiseProfile parameter values of

ðð \= 2 Ã 10â5 and ðð \= 4.5 Ã 10â7 (e.g., standard deviation of approximately 0.00201 when ð¥ \= 0.18); these values may be used to estimate absolute noise levels in an image when the NoiseProfile tag is missing. When both tags are present, however, DNG readers should prefer using the NoiseProfile data, since it describes noise levels more precisely than BaselineNoise.

A more detailed description of the noise model is given below. This tag models two common sources of noise:

1. Photon (shot) noise ð, which has a white Poisson distribution, and  
2. Electronic readout noise ð, which is present even in the absence of light and is assumed to have an approximately white normal (Gaussian) distribution.

Assuming that ð and ð are independent random variables, the square of the total noise (i.e., the variance) can be expressed as the sum of the squares of the individual sources of noise:

ð2 \= ð2 \+ ð2

In this expression, the variables ð, ð, and ð are expressed in B-bit recorded digital values, where common values of B include 12, 14, and 16 bits. If ð¥Ì is the average signal level expressed in photons, then its variance will also be ð¥Ì, since a random variable with a Poisson distribution has a variance equal to its mean:

ðÌ2 \= ð¥Ì

where ðÌ denotes the photon noise, expressed in photons. The conversion factor between photons (ð¥Ì, ðÌ) and B-bit digital values (ð¥, ð) is the gain factor ð:

ð¥ \= ð â ð¥Ì

ð \= ð â ðÌ

Substituting the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th equations into the first equation yields:

ð2 \= (ð â ðÌ)2 \+ ð2

\= (ð2 â ð¥Ì) \+ ð2

\= (ð â ð¥) \+ ð2

Therefore, the total noise ð can be expressed as a two-parameter function of the signal ð¥:

ð(ð¥) \= âð â ð¥ \+ ð2

\= âððð  \+ ðð

for model parameters

ðð \= ð

ðð \= ð2

This tag uses the convention of a normalized noise model, i.e., ð(ð¥) is the standard deviation (i.e., noise) of a random variable ð¥, where ð¥ represents a recorded linear signal in the range ð¥ â \[0,1\]. The specified parameters (ðð, ðð) must also be appropriately normalized.

**Additional Tags for Version 1.4.0.0**

The following tags have been added for the 1.4.0.0 version of this specification.

**DefaultUserCrop**

Tag	51125 (C7B5.H)

Type	RATIONAL

Count	4

Value	Top, Left, Bottom, Right Default	0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0

Usage	Raw IFD

Description

Specifies a default user crop rectangle in relative coordinates. The values must satisfy:

* 0 â¤ Top \< Bottom â¤ 1.0  
* 0 â¤ Left \< Right â¤ 1.0

The default values of (Top \= 0, Left \= 0, Bottom \= 1, Right \= 1\) correspond exactly to the default crop rectangle (as specified by the DefaultCropOrigin and DefaultCropSize tags).

**DefaultBlackRender**

Tag	51110 (C7A6.H)

Type	LONG

Count	1

Value	See below

Default	0

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

This optional tag in a color profile provides a hint to the raw converter regarding how to handle the black point (e.g., flare subtraction) during rendering. The currently defined values are:

* 0 \= Auto  
* 1 \= None

If set to Auto, the raw converter should perform black subtraction during rendering. The amount and method of black subtraction may be automatically determined and may be image-dependent.

If set to None, the raw converter should not perform any black subtraction during rendering. This may be desirable when using color lookup tables (e.g., LookTable) or tone curves in camera profiles to perform a fixed, consistent level of black subtraction.

**BaselineExposureOffset**

Tag	51109 (C7A5.H)

Type	RATIONAL

Count	1

Value	See below

Default	0.0

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

Provides a way for color profiles to increase or decrease exposure during raw conversion.

BaselineExposureOffset specifies the amount (in EV units) to add to the BaselineExposure tag during image rendering. For example, if the BaselineExposure value for a given camera model is \+0.3, and the BaselineExposureOffset value for a given camera profile used to render an image for that camera model is \- 0.7, then the actual default exposure value used during rendering will be \+0.3 \- 0.7 \= \-0.4.

**ProfileLookTableEncoding**

Tag	51108 (C7A4.H)

Type	LONG

Count	1

Value	See below

Default	0

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

Provides a way for color profiles to specify how indexing into a 3D LookTable is performed during raw conversion. This tag is not applicable to a 2.5D LookTable (i.e., where the Value dimension is 1).

The currently defined values are:

* 0 \= Linear encoding  
* 1 \= sRGB encoding

If set to 0 (Linear encoding), then the method used to apply a 3D LookTable is as follows:

1. Convert linear ProPhoto RGB values to HSV.  
2. Use the HSV coordinates to index into the color table.  
3. Apply color table result to the original HSV values.  
4. Convert modified HSV values back to linear ProPhoto RGB.

If set to 1 (sRGB encoding), then the method used to apply a 3D LookTable is as follows:

1. Convert linear ProPhoto RGB values to HSV.  
2. Encode V coordinate using the sRGB encoding curve.  
3. Use the encoded HSV coordinates to index into the color table.  
4. Apply color table result to the encoded values from step 3\.  
5. Decode V coordinate using the sRGB decoding curve (inverse of step 2).  
6. Convert HSV values back to linear ProPhoto RGB (inverse of step 1).

The second method (sRGB encoding) may be desirable to provide additional table precision to dark (shadow) image values.

Note that High Dynamic Range profiles affect the application of this tag. See [ProfileDynamicRange](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark157%22) and the [section on Applying the Hue/Value/Saturation Mapping Table](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark178%22) for details on applying the encoding function (prior to converting RGB to HSV) and applying the decoding function (after converting the HSV values back to RGB).

Type	LONG

Count	1

Value	See below

Default	0

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

Provides a way for color profiles to specify how indexing into a 3D HueSatMap is performed during raw conversion. This tag is not applicable to a 2.5D HueSatMap (i.e., where the Value dimension is 1).

The currently defined values are:

* 0 \= Linear encoding  
* 1 \= sRGB encoding

If set to 0 (Linear encoding), then the method used to apply a 3D HueSatMap is as follows:

1. Convert linear ProPhoto RGB values to HSV.  
2. Use the HSV coordinates to index into the color table.  
3. Apply color table result to the original HSV values.  
4. Convert modified HSV values back to linear ProPhoto RGB.

If set to 1 (sRGB encoding), then the method used to apply a 3D HueSatMap is as follows:

1. Convert linear ProPhoto RGB values to HSV.  
2. Encode V coordinate using the sRGB encoding curve.  
3. Use the encoded HSV coordinates to index into the color table.  
4. Apply color table result to the encoded values from step 3\.  
5. Decode V coordinate using the sRGB decoding curve (inverse of step 2).  
6. Convert HSV values back to linear ProPhoto RGB (inverse of step 1).

The second method (sRGB encoding) may be desirable to provide additional table precision to dark (shadow) image values.

Note that High Dynamic Range profiles affect the application of this tag. See [ProfileDynamicRange](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark157%22) and the [section on Applying the Hue/Value/Saturation Mapping Table](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark178%22) for details on applying the encoding function (prior to converting RGB to HSV) and applying the decoding function (after converting the HSV values back to RGB).

**ProfileGainTableMap**

Tag	52525 (CD2D.H)

Type	UNDEFINED

Count	Byte count of data; see below Value	See below  
Default	Optional

Usage	Raw IFD

Description

This tag contains spatially varying gain tables that can be applied while processing the image as a starting point for user adjustments.

This tag consists of the following parameters, in order: MapPointsV \- LONG  
MapPointsH \- LONG MapSpacingV \- DOUBLE MapSpacingH \- DOUBLE MapOriginV \- DOUBLE MapOriginH \- DOUBLE MapPointsN \- LONG  
MapInputWeights \- FLOAT Ã 5 (e.g., 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 0, 0\) For Each MapPointsV  
For Each MapPointsH

For Each MapPointsN

Gain value \- FLOAT

The tag count is the sum of the byte count of all the parameters listed above. This value is 64 \+ (4 \* MapPointsV \* MapPointsH \* MapPointsN). For example, if MapPointsV \= 6, MapPointsH \= 8, and MapPointsN  
\= 256, then the total tag size is 64 \+ (4 \* 6 \* 8 \* 256\) \= 49216 bytes.

The gain table map is a subsampled 2D matrix of 32-bit floating-point gain tables. MapPointsV is the number of tables in vertical direction. MapPointsH is the number of tables in the horizontal direction.

The gain table map is not required to cover the entire image being modified. Inside the gain table map bounds, the tables are interpolated using bi-linear interpolation. Outside the gain map bounds, values are replicated from the edges of the gain table map.

The origin of the gain table map relative to the image being modified is specified by MapOriginV (vertical direction) and MapOriginH (horizontal direction), which are in relative coordinates, where 1.0 is equal to the height or width of the image being modified, respectively. The origin values can be negative; this means that the gain table map may extend outside the image being modified.

The spacing between gain map points is specified by MapSpacingV (vertical direction) and MapSpacingH (horizontal direction). Again these are in relative coordinates, where 1.0 is equal to the height or width of the image being modified, respectively.

The gain values must be non-negative.

At each point in the image, up to four gain tables are interpolated to determine the gain table to apply at that location. Given the resulting interpolated table, the following method is used to produce an output RGB color given the input RGB color at that point in the image:

1. The âtable input valueâ is a scalar value calculated using the following equation:

table input value \= clamp ((R, G, B, min (R,G,B), max(R,G,B)) â MapInputWeights, 0, 1\)

1. Next, the âgain valueâ is calculated by using âtable input valueâ to perform a linearly interpolated  
   lookup of the gain table.  
1. The above gain is multiplied by the input RGB camera values to produce new RGB values. The resulting RGB values may be overrange (greater than 1). DNG readers are not required to clip the values to the nominal \[0,1\] range; readers are encouraged to preserve the overrange values for potential use in downstream tone adjustments.

ProfileGainTableMap should be applied by the DNG reader in the Reference Input Medium Metric (RIMM) color space. RIMM RGB values are obtained by mapping the native camera RGB values to CIE XYZ (see Chapter 6\) and then to RIMM.

ProfileGainTableMap should be applied after the BaselineExposure adjustment; the MapInputWeights values assume that BaselineExposure adjustment has already been applied.

ProfileGainTableMap should be applied after all opcodes have been applied, including all âwarpâ opcodes that may change the shape of the rendered image. That is, the ProfileGainTableMap x-y grid of gain tables is specified post-warp.

Details on sampling conventions:

* The horizontal and vertical positions of the gain table map should be sampled using pixel-centered (half-pixel) conventions.  
  * The area of the image to be modified is specified by the ActiveArea tag. For example, if the ActiveArea tag is T=10, L=8, B=3010, R=4008, then the top-left pixel (x,y) \= (8,10) corresponds to map sample position (0.5 / 4000, 0.5 / 3000), and the bottom-right pixel (x,y) \= (4007, 3009\) corresponds to map sample position (3999.5 / 4000, 2999.5 / 3000). Note the half-pixel offset, per the previous item.  
  * The table input value should be used to index directly into the gain table. That is, multiply the table input value by MapPointsN to compute the floating-point table index.

Additional notes:

* The usage of MapPointsV, MapPointsH, MapOriginV, MapOriginH, MapSpacingV, MapSpacingH is consistent with the definition of these fields from the GainMap opcode (see Chapter 7).  
  * This tag may be used in combination with the DNG ProfileToneCurve (tag 50940). If used together, the ProfileGainTableMap should be applied first while the image data is in a linear color space.  
  * The approximate size of this tag given 6 x 8 tables with 256 points is 48 Kb.

**SemanticName**

Tag	52526 (CD2E.H)

Type	ASCII

Count	String length including null Value	Null-terminated string

Default	Required tag

Usage	Semantic Mask IFD

Description

A string that identifies the semantic mask. If a DNG file contains multiple semantic masks, it is strongly recommended that the SemanticName strings in the masks be unique.

**SemanticInstanceID**

Tag	52528 (CD30.H)

Type	ASCII

Count	String length including null Value	Null-terminated string

Default	Optional

Usage	Semantic Mask IFD

Description

A string that identifies a specific instance in a semantic mask.

This tag can be used to relate the content of multiple semantic masks within a single DNG file. For example, suppose the main image in a DNG file is a picture of two persons. The file contains four semantic masks:

1. A mask representing the skin of Person A. SemanticName is set to "skin\_mask" and SemanticInstanceID is set to "person\_a"  
2. A mask representing the hair of Person A. SemanticName is set to "hair\_mask" and SemanticInstanceID is set to "person\_a"  
3. A mask representing the skin of Person B. SemanticName is set to "skin\_mask" and SemanticInstanceID is set to "person\_b"  
4. A mask representing the hair of Person B. SemanticName is set to "hair\_mask" and SemanticInstanceID is set to "person\_b"

In general, this tag cannot be used to relate content between two different DNG files. For example, semantic masks representing the same person may be assigned different string values across different DNG files.

**MaskSubArea**

Tag	52536 (CD38.H)

Type	LONG

Count	4

Value	See below

Default	0, 0, MaskWidth, MaskHeight Usage	Semantic Mask IFD  
Description

This tag identifies the crop rectangle of this IFD's mask, relative to the main image. For example, a semantic mask that identifies the foreground subject may be cropped to the subject's extent within the image, thereby reducing file size.

The first two values are the origin of the cropped mask. The last two values are the dimensions of the uncropped mask. Together, these four values (plus the dimensions of the cropped mask, which are provided by the ImageWidth and ImageLength tags in the same IFD), completely describe how the cropped mask relates to the main image.

The four 32-bit unsigned integer values are, in order:

* T\_crop \= top coordinate of the cropped mask  
* L\_crop \= left coordinate of the cropped mask  
* W\_full \= width of full / uncropped mask  
* H\_full \= height of full / uncropped mask

The term "uncropped mask" refers conceptually to the entire mask, which corresponds to the ActiveArea of the main image.

The term "cropped mask" refers to the actual mask stored in this IFD.

If this tag is absent, it is assumed that the mask covers the entire ActiveArea. Pixels outside the cropped mask are assumed to have value 0\.  
If either of the following is true, then the tag is invalid and should be ignored:

* T\_crop \+ ImageWidth \> H\_full  
* L\_crop \+ ImageLength \> W\_full

Example

The ActiveArea of a DNG has (top, left, bottom, right) coordinate values of (top, left, bottom, right) \= (0, 0, 3024, 4032).

The DNG contains a Semantic Mask stored at reduced resolution. The "uncropped mask area" is (0, 0, 800, 1200).

Suppose this Semantic Mask has non-zero pixels for only a small 200x200 sub-rectangle: (100, 80, 300, 280). Thus, it is not necessary to store an entire 1200 x 800 mask image. Instead, it suffices to record a Semantic Mask IFD with ImageWidth \= 200, ImageLength \= 200, and a MaskSubArea tag with the following values:

**Field	Value**

T\_crop 100

L\_crop 80

W\_full  1200

H\_full	800

If a DNG reader needs to resample the Semantic Mask (e.g., so that it matches the full image resolution), then the correct scaling is the transform that maps (0, 0, 800, 1200\) to the ActiveArea (0, 0, 3024, 4032).

**RGBTables**

Tag	52543 (CD3F.H)

Type	UNDEFINED

Count	See below

Value	See below

Default	Optional

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

This tag specifies color transforms that can be applied to masked image regions. Color transforms are specified using RGB-to-RGB color lookup tables. These tables are associated with Semantic Masks to limit the color transform to a sub-region of the image. The overall color transform is a linear combination of the color tables, weighted by their corresponding Semantic Masks.

The data format of the tag is: NumTables â LONG CompositeMethod â LONG

For each table T (from 1 to NumTables):

data for table T

The format of the data for each table is: LengthTableSemanticName \- SHORT TableSemanticName \- ASCII (not null-terminated) Divisions \- BYTE

PixelType â BYTE GammaEncoding \- BYTE ColorPrimaries \- BYTE GamutExtension \- BYTE For each red index r

For each green index g

For each blue index b

red value for table entry (r,g,b) green value for table entry (r,g,b) blue value for table entry (r,g,b)

Notes on the tag fields

**NumTables** is the number of tables and must be in the range 1 to 20\.

**CompositeMethod** must be either 0 or 1\. A value of 0 means that tables are applied using the Weighted Sum Method. A value of 1 means that tables are applied using the Sequential Method. See below for details on both methods.

**LengthTableSemanticName** is the byte length of the TableSemanticName tag. A value of 0 represents the special case of a "background table" â see below for details. If multiple tables are specified (NumTables \> 1), then at most one of those tables can have a zero value for LengthTableSemanticName.

**TableSemanticName** is an ASCII string corresponding to one of the SemanticName tags whose mask should be used to apply the table. This tag has length LengthTableSemanticName bytes and is not null-terminated. If LengthTableSemanticName is 0, then this field is omitted. Otherwise, matches between TableSemanticName and SemanticName are made using case-sensitive comparisons; if no match is found, the table is ignored.

**Divisions** is the linear resolution of the table and must be in the range 2 to 32\. The total number of table entries is Divisions x Divisions x Divisions.

**PixelType** is the pixel type of each table entry and must be 0, 1, or 2\. These values have the following meaning:

*PixelType	Meaning*

1. 8-bit unsigned integer (0 to 255\)  
2. 16-bit unsigned integer (0 to 65535\)  
3. 32-bit floating-point (0.0 to 1.0)

The **GammaEncoding** tag indicates the input and output gamma encoding of the table. That is, the table should be applied to pixel values that have been encoding using the specified gamma encoding curve; the output pixel values computed by the table will also be encoded using the same curve. This tag must be in the range 0 to 4 and has the following interpretation:

*GammaEncoding	Meaning*

1. Linear  
2. sRGB  
3. 1.8  
4. 2.2  
5. Rec. 2020

The **ColorPrimaries** tag indicates are the input and output RGB primaries of the table. That is, the table should be applied to pixel values that have been mapped to these RGB primaries; the output pixel values computed by the table will also be in the same primaries. This tag must be in the range 0 to 4 and has the following interpretation:

| *ColorPrimaries* | *Meaning* | *Reference White Point* |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0 | sRGB | D65 |
| 1 | Adobe RGB | D65 |
| 2 | Display P3 | D65 |
| 3 | Rec. 2020 | D65 |
| 4 | ProPhoto | D50 |

The **GamutExtension** tag indicates whether or not to perform "gamut extension" when applying the color table transform. This tag must have a value of 0 or 1 with the following interpretation:

| *GamutExtension* | *Meaning* |
| :---- | :---- |
| 0 | Do not perform gamut extension. Output pixel values will be clipped to the color space implied by the ColorPrimaries tag. |
| 1 | Perform gamut extension. For out-of-gamut pixels, compute the difference between the gamut-clipped values and the unclipped values; add the difference to the table- transformed result. Details on the gamut extension math are given below. |

In general, it is recommended to use gamut extension (set the tag to 1).

Background Table

This tag supports the concept of a "background table" â namely, a color lookup table that can be applied to "background" pixels that are not covered by one of the other tables. Two examples:

**Example 1: portrait and background**

A DNG file represents a photograph of a person. The goal is to define two separate color transforms: one for the person and another for the background. Steps to implement this:

* Store a semantic mask in the file with the SemanticName tag set to "portrait\_subject"  
* Store a RGBTables tag in the file with two tables:  
  * The first table has TableSemanticName set to "portrait\_subject" and defines the color transform to be applied to the person  
  * The second table has an empty TableSemanticName (LengthTableSemanticName set to 0\) and defines the color transform to be applied to the background

Notes on the above example:

* The actual value of the SemanticName tag is not important. The key is to use the same value for SemanticName and TableSemanticName so that the color transform can be matched to that mask.  
* When using the Weighted Sum composite method, the order of the two tables within the RGBTables tag is not important. When using the Sequential composite method, the portrait table will be applied first, then the background table, because this is the order they are specified in the tag.

**Example 2: two portraits, sky, and background**

A DNG file represents a photograph of two people in an outdoor setting with the sky visible. The goal is to define four separate color transforms: one for each person, one for the sky, and one for the background. Steps to implement this:

* Store semantic masks in the file for each person and the sky, with appropriate SemanticName tag values such as "subject1" "subject2" and "sky"  
* Store a RGBTables tag in the file with four tables:  
  * The first table has TableSemanticName set to "subject1" and defines the color transform to be applied to the first person  
  * The second table has TableSemanticName set to "subject2" and defines the color transform to be applied to the second person  
  * The third table has TableSemanticName set to "sky" and defines the color transform to be applied to the sky  
  * The fourth table has an empty TableSemanticName (LengthTableSemanticName set to 0\) and defines the color transform to be applied to the background

Note that at most one table in this tag can be used as the background table. That is, at most one table can use a zero value for LengthTableSemanticName. If no tables specify a zero value for LengthTableSemanticName, then there is no background table.

Table transform pipeline

This section describes the table transform pipeline using the GammaEncoding, ColorPrimaries, and GamutExtension tags.

Let **original\_space** be the input RGB color space (before applying the table). In most cases this will be a standard RGB space such as sRGB or ProPhoto RGB.

Let **table\_space** be the linear RGB color space specified by the ColorPrimaries tag (ignoring gamma encoding).

Let **table\_gamma** be the gamma encoding curve specified by the GammaEncoding tag. The steps are:

1. If needed, decode gamma for original\_space. For example, if original\_space is sRGB, then this step applies the sRGB decoding curve, so that the result pixel values are in "linear gamma" sRGB.  
2. Apply 3x3 matrix transform to table\_space.  
3. If the camera profile is High Dynamic Range (see [ProfileDynamicRange](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark157%22)), then apply the encoding function ð(ð¥) to each component.  
4. Clamp each component to \[0, 1\]  
5. Compute Delta \=  
   * difference between Step 4 and Step 3 (if GamutExtension is 1\)  
   * 0 (if GamutExtension is 0\)  
6. Apply GammaEncoding curve.  
7. Apply 3D table.  
8. Apply inverse of Step 6 (undo GammaEncoding curve).  
9. Add Delta computed in Step 5\.  
10. If the camera profile is High Dynamic Range, then apply the decoding function ðâ1(ð¥) to each component.  
11. Apply inverse of Step 2 (transform back to original\_space with linear gamma).

Notes on applying the color transforms

There are two methods for applying color transforms: Weighted Sum Method and Sequential Method. The method is specified using the CompositeMethod field.

**Weighted Sum Method**

The overall color transform is a linear combination of the tables, weighted by their corresponding Semantic Masks and a special weight for the Background Table (if any).

To make this precise, consider the following definitions:

* Let ð be the number of tables, comprising one Background Table and ð â 1 tables with Semantic Masks  
  * Let ðð be the ith color table transform with a Semantic Mask, where ð ranges from 1 to ð â 1  
  * Let ðµ be the Background color table transform, or the identity transform if there is no Background

  Table

  * Let ðð be the Semantic Mask corresponding to ðð  
  * Let ðððð be the source color of a given pixel

To compute the final pixel color ðððð ð¢ðð¡, use the following equation:

âðâ1(ðð â ðð (ðððð)) \+ (ð â ðµ(ðððð))

ðððð ð¢ðð¡ \=  
ð=0

âðâ1 ðð \+ ð

where

ðâ1

ð \= 1 â min (1, â ðð)

ð=0

Note that if all the Semantic Masks have zero weight (all ðð are zero) for a given pixel, then the background weight ð will be 1\. Furthermore, if there is no background table (ðµ is the identity transform), then

ðððð ð¢ðð¡ \= ðððð.

**Sequential Method**

The overall color transform is the result of applying each table sequentially (i.e., in an ordered list). The order of application is the same as the order of the tables specified in the tag. That is, the first table specified is the first table applied, the second table specified is the second table applied, and so on.

More precisely, using the same definitions as above:

ðð+1 \= ðð \+ ðð(ð(ðð) â ðð)

For example, if there are 3 tables (ð \= 3), then:

ð0 \= ðððð

ð1 \= ð0 \+ ð0(ð(ð0) â ð0)

ð2 \= ð1 \+ ð1(ð(ð1) â ð1)

ð3 \= ð2 \+ ð2(ð(ð2) â ð2)

ðððð ð¢ðð¡ \= ð3

The background table is optional; it may appear at most once in the list. The mask value ð of the background table is the same as defined in the Weighted Sum Method. For example, continuing the above 3-table example, if the first table is the background table, then

ð1 \= ð0 \+ ð(ðµ(ð0) â ð0)

**Other Notes**

Table entries should be interpolated using a smooth method, such as trilinear or tetrahedral interpolation. The color transforms should be applied after the ProfileToneCurve tag.  
This tag was originally introduced in DNG 1.6 with usage in IFD 0 only.

Starting with DNG 1.7, usage is allowed in both IFD 0 and Camera Profile IFD. When a reader is rendering a raw file with a camera profile, the profileâs RGBTables tag takes precedence of any RGBTables in IFD 0\.

This tag contains the data for the third hue/saturation/value mapping table. Each entry of the table contains three 32-bit IEEE floating-point values. The first entry is hue shift in degrees; the second entry is saturation scale factor; and the third entry is a value scale factor. The table entries are stored in the tag in nested loop order, with the value divisions in the outer loop, the hue divisions in the middle loop, and the saturation divisions in the inner loop. All zero input saturation entries are required to have a value scale factor of 1.0. The hue/saturation/value table application and requirements are described in detail in Chapter 6\.

**ForwardMatrix3**

Tag	52532 (CD34.H)

Type	SRATIONAL

Count	ColorPlanes \* 3

Value	See below

Default	None

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

This tag defines a matrix that maps white balanced camera colors to XYZ D50 colors. Application and requirements are described in detail in Chapter 6\.

**IlluminantData1**

Tag	52533 (CD35.H)

Type	UNDEFINED

Count	See below

Value	See below

Default	None

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

When the CalibrationIlluminant1 tag is set to 255 (Other), then the IlluminantData1 tag is required and specifies the data for the first illuminant. Otherwise, this tag is ignored.

The illuminant data may be specified as either a x-y chromaticity coordinate or as a spectral power distribution function.

The format of the tag data is as follows.

The first 2 bytes is a SHORT integer describing the data type. A value of 0 means the data is a x-y chromaticity coordinate. A value of 1 means the data is a spectral power distribution function.

If the data type is 0 (x-y chromaticity coordinate), then the tag format is: DataType \- SHORT (0)

x \- RATIONAL y \- RATIONAL

If the data type is 1 (spectral power function), then the tag format is: DataType \- SHORT (1)  
NumLambda \- LONG MinLambda \- RATIONAL LambdaSpacing \- RATIONAL For each NumLambda  
Spectral power distribution function value \- RATIONAL

**MinLambda** is the wavelength of the first sample, in nanometers, and should typically be between 360 and 400\.

**LambdaSpacing** is the spacing between adjacent samples, in nanometers.

**NumLambda** is the total number of samples. It must be at least 2\.

It is recommended that the provided spectral data cover at least 360 nm to 830 nm.

For example, if MinLambda is 360, LambdaSpacing is 10, and NumLambda is 48, then the spectral power distribution function is provided from 360 to 830 nm in 10 nm increments. The first sample is at 360 nm, the 2nd is at 370 nm, the 3rd is at 380 nm, and so on; the last sample is at 830 nm.

The x-y chromaticity coordinate of the illuminant is calculated by integrating the provided spectral power distribution with the CIE 2-degree standard observer functions from 360 nm to 830 nm. Wavelengths below the minimum lambda value (MinLambda) map to the first provided spectral value; wavelengths above the

maximum lambda value map to the last provided spectral value. Wavelengths in between adjacent sample values are mapped using linear interpolation.

**IlluminantData2**

Tag	52534 (CD36.H)

Type	UNDEFINED

Count	See below

Value	See below

Default	None

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

When the CalibrationIlluminant2 tag is set to 255 (Other), then the IlluminantData2 tag is required and specifies the data for the second illuminant. Otherwise, this tag is ignored.

The format of the data is the same as IlluminantData1.

**IlluminantData3**

Tag	52535 (CD37.H)

Type	UNDEFINED

Count	See below

Value	See below

Default	None

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

When the CalibrationIlluminant3 tag is set to 255 (Other), then the IlluminantData3 tag is required and specifies the data for the third illuminant. Otherwise, this tag is ignored.

The format of the data is the same as IlluminantData1.

**Additional Tags for Version 1.7.0.0**

The following tags have been added for the 1.7.0.0 version of this specification.

**ProfileGainTableMap2**

Tag	52544 (CD40.H)

Type	UNDEFINED

Count	Byte count of data; see below Value	See below  
Default	Optional

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

This tag is an extended version of ProfileGainTableMap. It consists of the following parameters, in order: MapPointsV \- LONG  
MapPointsH \- LONG MapSpacingV \- DOUBLE MapSpacingH \- DOUBLE MapOriginV \- DOUBLE MapOriginH \- DOUBLE MapPointsN \- LONG  
MapInputWeights \- FLOAT Ã 5 (e.g., 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 0, 0\) DataType \- LONG  
Gamma \- FLOAT GainMin \- FLOAT GainMax \- FLOAT  
For Each MapPointsV

For Each MapPointsH

For Each MapPointsN

Gain value \- UINT8, UINT16, FLOAT16, or FLOAT (see below)

The tag count is the sum of the byte count of all the parameters listed above. This value is 80 \+ (B \* MapPointsV \* MapPointsH \* MapPointsN), where

* B is 1 if DataType is 0 (unsigned 8-bit integer)  
* B is 2 if DataType is 1 or 2 (unsigned 16-bit integer or 16-bit floating-point)  
* B if 4 if DataType is 3 (32-bit floating point)

For example, if MapPointsV \= 6, MapPointsH \= 8, and MapPointsN \= 256, and DataType is 0 (8-bit unsigned integer), then the total tag size is 80 \+ (1 \* 6 \* 8 \* 256\) \= 12368 bytes.

This tag is the same as the existing ProfileGainTableMap, with the following changes:

* Addition of the DataType, Gamma, GainMin, and GainMax parameters (see below for details)  
* The gain values can be specified using integers or floating-point values

DataType

DataType must be one of the following values:

| DataType | Storage type of gain value | Notes |
| :---: | :---- | :---- |
| 0 | 8-bit unsigned integer | Must use GainMin and GainMax |
| 1 | 16-bit unsigned integer | Must use GainMin and GainMax |
| 2 | 16-bit floating point | GainMin and GainMax are ignored |
| 3 | 32-bit floating point | GainMin and GainMax are ignored |

Gamma

Gamma is a parameter that is applied to the weighted input value prior to table lookup (see details below). A value of 1.0 is a NOP (no change). The minimum and maximum allowed gamma values are 0.25 and 4.0, respectively.

GainMin and GainMax

For the case where DataType is 0 or 1 (integer representation of gain values), GainMin and GainMax represent the minimum and maximum 32-bit floating-point values, respectively. For example, if GainMin is  
0.7 and GainMax is 2.3, and the DataType is 0 (8-bit unsigned integer), then a stored 8-bit value of 0 represents the minimum gain of 0.7, and the maximum stored 8-bit value of 255 represents the maximum gain value of 2.3.

Application

At each point in the image, up to four gain tables are interpolated to determine the gain table to apply at that location. Given the resulting interpolated table, the following method is used to produce an output RGB color given the input RGB color at that point in the image:

1. The âtable input valueâ is a scalar value calculated using the following equation:  
   table input value \= pow (clamp ((R, G, B, min (R,G,B), max(R,G,B)) â MapInputWeights, 0, 1), Gamma)  
1. Next, the âgain valueâ **G** is calculated by using âtable input valueâ to perform a linearly interpolated  
   lookup of the gain table.  
1. If DataType is 0 (8-bit unsigned integer) or 1 (16-bit unsigned integer), then the value obtained in Step 2 is mapped to the floating-point gain using the GainMin and GainMax parameters as follows:  
   FloatGain \= GainMin \+ (**G** / MaxInt) \* (GainMax \- GainMin) where MaxInt is 255.0 if DataType is 0 and 65535.0 if DataType is 1\.  
1. The above gain is multiplied by the input RGB camera values to produce new RGB values. The resulting RGB values may be overrange (greater than 1). DNG readers are not required to clip the values to the nominal \[0,1\] range; readers are encouraged to preserve the overrange values for potential use in downstream tone adjustments.

Compatibility with ProfileGainTableMap

Both ProfileGainTableMap and ProfileGainTableMap2 tags may be present. If both are present, then ProfileGainTableMap2 supersedes ProfileGainTableMap; that is, DNG readers should apply only ProfileGainTableMap2 and ignore ProfileGainTableMap. This behavior is intended for compatibility reasons.

If ProfileGainTableMap2 is used in a Camera Profile IFD and that profile is used to render a raw file, the profile-specific ProfileGainTableMap2 should be used instead of a ProfileGainTableMap2 specified in the Raw IFD.

IFD 0 vs Camera Profile IFD

ProfileGainTableMap2 can be used in either IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD. The latter option allows ProfileGainTableMap2 to be a per-camera profile property.

When a raw file is rendered using that profile, that profileâs ProfileGainTableMap2 should be used instead of any ProfileGainTableMap2 specified in IFD 0\.

When a raw file is rendered using a profile that does not specify a ProfileGainTableMap2, then any ProfileGainTableMap2 in IFD 0 or ProfileGainTableMap in Raw IFD should be used.

Summary of the precedence order for choosing which data to use:

* ProfileGainTableMap2 in Camera Profile IFD (highest precedence)  
* ProfileGainTableMap2 in IFD 0  
* ProfileGainTableMap in Raw IFD (lowest precedence)

IFD 0 vs Raw IFD

The intent of the original ProfileGainTableMap tag (introduced in DNG 1.6) was to use IFD 0\. However, the DNG 1.6 specification mistakenly indicated âRaw IFDâ instead of IFD 0\. This is an error, because the same gain table map operation is meaningful for all scene-referred IFDs in the file, including raw previews and Enhanced IFDs (not only the raw IFD).

ProfileGainTableMap2 (introduced in DNG 1.7) uses IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD.

**ImageSequenceInfo**

Tag	52548 (CD44.H)

Type	UNDEFINED

Count	Byte count of data

Value	See below

Default   Optional

Usage	IFD 0

Description

This is an informative tag that describes how the image file relates to other image files captured in a sequence. Applications include focus stacking, merging multiple frames to reduce noise, time lapses, exposure brackets, stitched images for super resolution, and so on.

The following table describes the fields in this tag, in order:

| Field | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Sequence ID | Null-terminated ASCII string at least 8 characters | Unique identifier of the image sequence. All image files in the sequence should use the same string. It is recommended that DNG writers use a prefix unique to the author or company, e.g., prefix âcom.adobeâ as part of a broader identifier âcom.adobe.F92C483A22B7â |
| Sequence Type | Null-terminated ASCII string at least 1 character | Type of image sequence. All image files in this sequence should use the same string. See below for details. |
| Frame Info | Null-terminated ASCII string | Information specific to this image within the sequence. This string may be empty, and its contents may vary from image to image within the sequence. |
| Index | 32-bit unsigned integer, big-endian | The 1-based index of the image within the sequence (i.e., the first frame in the sequence has index value 1). A value of 0 means the index is unknown or not available. |
| Count | 32-bit unsigned integer, big-endian | The total number of images in the sequence. A value of 0 means the count is unknown or not available. |
| Final | 8-bit unsigned integer | Indicator of final image in the sequence: 0 \= no, this is not the final image 1 \= yes, this is the final image other \= unknown if this is the final image |

The Sequence Type field should be a human-readable string describing the purpose of the image sequence. It may be vendor-specific or camera model-specific.

Example values include:

* Exposure Bracket  
* Focus Stack  
* Timelapse  
* CFA Shift  
* Panorama Segment  
* Burst Denoise

**ImageStats**

Tag	52550 (CD46.H)

Type	UNDEFINED

Count	Byte count of data

Value	See below

Default	Optional

Usage	Raw IFD

Description

This is an informative tag that provides basic statistical information about the pixel values of the image in this IFD. Possible applications include normalizing brightness of images when multiple images are displayed together (especially when mixing Standard Dynamic Range and High Dynamic Range images), identifying underexposed or overexposed images, and so on.

All floating-point values in this tag use a normalized convention where 0.0 corresponds to black and 1.0 corresponds to white. The statistics describe the state of the image after mapping to linear reference values ([as described in this chapter](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark164%22)), so that the black level is mapped to 0.0 and the white level is mapped to 1.0.

The data in this tag is stored in big-endian byte order. The format of this tag data is:

LONG â Number of child tags (N) Child tag table

The child tag table is a tightly-packed sequence of N child tags, where N is the number of child tags. The format of each child tag is:

LONG \- Child tag code

LONG â Byte length of child tag data (L) Child tag data (L bytes)

The set of child tags is described in the following table:

| Child Tag Code | Byte Length | Child Tag Data | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | 4 | 32-bit float | Weighted average pixel value |
| 2 | 4 \+ (8 \* M) | See below | List of M weighted samples |
| 3 | 4 \* P | P 32-bit floats | Weight values used to compute weighted average and samples (child tags 1 and 2\) |
| 4 | 4 \* P | P 32-bit floats | Per-color plane average pixel values |
| 5 | 4 \+ (M \* 4 \* (P \+ 1)) | See below | List of M per-color plane samples |

For child tags 3 through 5, the variable P represents the number of color planes. It must match the number of color planes for the image in the IFD that includes this tag.

Child tag 1 is the weighted average pixel value. For a color image, the weighted average is computed using a linear combination of pixel values. For example, for RGB data where P is 3:

ð¦ \= ð1ð \+ ð2ð \+ ð3ð

where ð1, ð2, and ð3 are the weights described in child tag 3\. The same weighting formula is used for child tag 2 (list of weighted samples).

Child tag 4 is similar to child tag 1, except that the average pixel values are specified separately for each color plane. For monochrome images, child tags 1 and 4 are logically equivalent.

Child tags 2 and 5 specify a list of samples associated with an order. They can be used to provide ordered statistics similar to a histogram. The difference between these tags is that child tag 2 uses weighted pixel values (using the weights described in child tag 3), whereas child tag 5 uses per-color plane values.

The data format for child tag 2 is: LONG â number of samples M  
FLOAT â fractional position ð¹1 for sample 1 FLOAT â weighted value for sample 1 FLOAT â fractional position ð¹2 for sample 2 FLOAT â weighted value for sample 2  
â¦

FLOAT â fractional position ð¹ð for sample M

FLOAT â weighted value for sample M

The data format for child tag 5 is similar but uses per-color plane (not weighted) values: LONG â number of samples M  
FLOAT â fractional position ð¹1 for sample 1 FLOAT â value for color plane 1 of sample 1

â¦

FLOAT â value for color plane P of sample 1

â¦

FLOAT â fractional position ð¹ð for sample M FLOAT â value for color plane 1 of sample M

â¦

FLOAT â value for color plane P of sample M

The âfractional positionâ F of a given sample is a value in \[0,1\] that describes the relative position of that sample, compared to the values of other samples in the image.

Let S be the total number of pixels in the image. Sort the pixels of a single color plane (or weighted color plane) in the image in ascending (increasing order). The first pixel in the sorted list has the minimum value. The last pixel in the sorted list has the maximum value. Given a pixel at position N in the sorted list, where N is in \[0, S-1\], define the fractional position F as:

ð  
ð¹ \= ð â 1

Examples:

* F \= 0.0 corresponds to the first sorted pixel (N \= 0). It is the minimum pixel value.  
* F \= 1.0 corresponds to the last sorted pixel (N \= S \- 1). It is the maximum pixel value.  
* F \= 0.5 corresponds (approximately) to the middle pixel. It is the median pixel value. Notes and restrictions on child tags 2 and 5 (list of samples):  
* There must be at least 1 sample (ð â¥ 1) per list.  
* The maximum number of samples per list is 1024 (ð â¤ 1024).  
* The samples must appear in order of strictly ascending (increasing) values of F. No fractional position value may be repeated. For instance, if a list has 3 samples with fractional positions ð¹1, ð¹2, and ð¹3, then it must be that ð¹1 \< ð¹2 \< ð¹3.  
* For monochrome images, child tags 2 and 5 are logically identical.

For child tags 4 and 5, which describe per-color plane information, the order of the data values follows the plane order specified by the CFAPlaneColor tag (for CFA images).

All child tags are optional and may be included in any combination. For example, a writer may choose to include only child tag 1 (weighted average pixel value), without indicating what the weight values are (i.e., omitting child tag 3).

Child tags may appear in any order in the child tag table.

Child tags may not be repeated. That is, a child tag may appear at most once in a table. An empty child tag table (N \= 0\) is permitted.  
For performance reasons, DNG writers may compute the values of this tag using downsampled (lower- resolution) images. DNG readers should assume the values in this tag are approximate.

**ProfileDynamicRange**

Tag	52551 (CD47.H)

Type	UNDEFINED

Count	8

Value	See below

Default	Optional (Standard Dynamic Range) Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD  
Description

This tag describes the intended rendering output dynamic range for a given camera profile.

If this tag is omitted, then it is assumed that the intended output dynamic range of the profile is Standard Dynamic Range (SDR). That is, the rendered output pixels are limited to the range \[0, 1\], where 1.0 is the âuser interface white levelâ (UI White) of the display.

The data format of the tag is: SHORT â Version SHORT â DynamicRange

FLOAT â HintMaxOutputValue

The Version field describes the version of this tag. It must have the value 1\.

DynamicRange indicates the intended output dynamic range of the profile. Supported values are:

1. â Standard Dynamic Range  
2. â High Dynamic Range

A value of 1 (High Dynamic Range) indicates that the given camera profile should be applied in High Dynamic Range mode. There are two aspects of this behavior.

First, the final rendered pixel values may have values outside of \[0, 1\]. For example, an output pixel value of

4.0 appears 4 times as bright as UI White, assuming a linear gamma encoding of the image. Implementations should avoid prematurely clipping intermediate pixel values within their rendering pipelines to \[0, 1\].

Second, the math for applying several of the camera profile tags is adjusted for HDR camera profiles to accommodate overrange values. These tags are:

* ProfileHueSatMapData\[1,2,3\]  
* [ProfileHueSatMapEncoding](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark124%22)  
* [ProfileLookTableData](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark113%22)  
* [ProfileLookTableEncoding](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark123%22)  
* [ProfileToneCurve](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark97%22)  
* [RGBTables](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark143%22)

For each of the above tags, the general method for applying them to HDR data is:

* Apply an encoding function ð(ð¥) to each color component.  
* Apply the tag normally (same as in SDR mode), but without clipping the results to \[0, 1\].  
* Apply a decoding function ðâ1(ð¥) to each color component. The encoding function ð(ð¥) is:  
  ð¥(256 \+ ð¥)

ð(ð¥) \= 256(1 \+ ð¥)

The decoding function ðâ1(ð¥) is the inverse of ð(ð¥):

ðâ1(ð¥) \= 16 (8ð¥ â 8 \+ â64ð¥2 â 127ð¥ \+ 64\)

The encoding function smoothly compresses the overrange domain \[0, 16\] to a normalized range \[0, 1\]. This provides a mechanism for lookup tables and curves (which are normally defined on a limited range \[0, 1\]) to operate on overrange data. More details on applying the tags for High Dynamic Range profiles are given in the descriptions of each tag and in [the section on Applying the Hue/Saturation/Value Mapping Table](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark178%22).

HintMaxOutputValue is a hint that describes the intended maximum output pixel value for the given camera profile, expressed using a linear gamma encoding (gamma 1.0). For example, a value of 8.0 indicates that the intended rendered output pixel values should not exceed 8.0 (or 3 f-stops above UI White). When DynamicRange is 0 (SDR), HintMaxOutputValue must be â¤ 1. A value less than or equal to 0 indicates no hint (unknown).

**ProfileGroupName**

Tag	52552 (CD48.H)

Type	ASCII or BYTE

Count	Length of string including null Value	Null-terminated string  
Default	Optional

Usage	IFD 0 or Camera Profile IFD

Description

A UTF-8 encoded string containing the âgroup nameâ of the camera profile. The purpose of this tag is to associate two or more related camera profiles into a common group. A potential application of this tag is to relate two profiles, one of which is intended for Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) rendering and the other of which is intended for High Dynamic Range (HDR) rendering. The reader can select which profile within the group is appropriate based on the desired output dynamic range.

For example, a DNG file could contain 4 embedded profiles as follows:

| ProfileName | ProfileDynamicRange | ProfileGroup | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Portrait SDR | SDR (DynamicRange \= 0\) | Portrait | A camera profile optimized for portrait photos, designed for SDR display. |
| Portrait HDR | HDR (DynamicRange \= 1\) | Portrait | A camera profile optimized for portrait photos, designed for HDR display. |
| Landscape SDR | SDR (DynamicRange \= 0\) | Landscape | A camera profile optimized for landscape photos, designed for SDR display. |
| Landscape HDR | HDR (DynamicRange \= 1\) | Landscape | A camera profile optimized for landscape photos, designed for HDR display. |

**Additional Tags for Version 1.7.1.0**

The following tags have been added for the 1.7.0.0 version of this specification.

**ColumnInterleaveFactor**

Tag	52547 (CD43.H)

Type	SHORT or LONG

Count	1

Value	ColumnInterleaveFactor Default	1

Usage	Raw IFD

Description

This tag specifies that columns of the image are stored in interleaved order. The value of the tag specifies the number of interleaved fields. The use of a non-default value for this tag requires setting the DNGBackwardVersion tag to at least 1.7.1.0.

Potential Usage

This tag can be used in combination with [RowInterleaveFactor](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark111%22) to store Color Filter Array (mosaic) image data as a set of subimages. This may be useful when using compression methods that do not natively support interleaved pixels.

For example, a Bayer mosaic image with a 2x2 CFA pattern can be stored as a set of four monochrome subimages, each of which are Â½ the width and Â½ the height of the full image, by setting both RowInterleaveFactor and ColumnInterleaveFactor to 2\. The top-left color of the 2x2 pattern maps to the top- left subimage (e.g., red), the top-right color maps to the top-right subimage (e.g., green), and so on. Each subimage can be compressed independently.

**JXLDistance**

Tag	52553 (CD49.H)

Type	FLOAT

Count	1

Value	JPEG XL distance parameter Default	Optional

Usage	IFD using JXL compression

Description

This optional tag specifies the distance parameter used to encode the JPEG XL data in this IFD. A value of 0.0 means lossless compression, while values greater than 0.0 means lossy compression.

**JXLEffort**

Tag	52554 (CD4A.H)

Type	LONG

Count	1

Value	JPEG XL effort parameter Default	Optional

Usage	IFD using JPEG XL compression

Description

This optional tag specifies the effort parameter used to encode the JPEG XL data in this IFD. Values range from 1 (low) to 9 (high).

**JXLDecodeSpeed**

Tag	52555 (CD4B.H)

Type	LONG

Count	1

Value	JPEG XL decode speed parameter Default	Optional  
Usage	IFD using JXL compression

Description

This optional tag specifies the decode speed parameter used to encode the JPEG XL data in this IFD. Values range from 1 (slow) to 4 (fast).

Mapping Raw Values to Linear Reference Values

The section describes DNG's processing model for mapping stored raw sensor values into linear reference values.

Linear reference values encode zero light as 0.0, and the maximum useful value (limited by either sensor saturation or analog to digital converter clipping) as 1.0. If SamplesPerPixel is greater than one, each sample plane should be processed independently.

The processing model follows these steps:

* [Linearization](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark165%22)  
* [Black Subtraction](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark166%22)  
* [Rescaling](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark167%22)  
* [Clipping](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark168%22)

**Linearization**

The first step is to process the raw values through the look-up table specified by the LinearizationTable tag, if any. If the raw value is greater than the size of the table, it is mapped to the last entry of the table.

**Black Subtraction**

The black level for each pixel is then computed and subtracted. The black level for each pixel is the sum of the black levels specified by the BlackLevel, BlackLevelDeltaH and BlackLevelDeltaV tags.

**Rescaling (Normalization)**

The black subtracted values are then rescaled to map them to a logical 0.0 to 1.0 range. The scale factor is the inverse of the difference between the value specified in the WhiteLevel tag and the maximum computed black level for the sample plane.

**Clipping**

Rescaled values above 1.0 should be clipped to 1.0. Rescaled values below 0.0 may be clipped to 0.0, but it is recommended to preserve negative values for at least the early stages of an image rendering pipeline (e.g., for better noise reduction in the shadows).

Mapping Camera Color Space to CIE XYZ Space

This section describes the DNG processing model for mapping between the camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) and CIE XYZ (with a D50 white point).

**Camera Calibration Matrices**

DNG 1.2.0.0 and later supports different companies creating the camera calibration tags using different reference cameras.

When rendering a DNG file using a camera profile, it is important to know if the selected camera profile was designed using the same reference camera used to create the camera calibration tags. If so, then the camera calibration tags should be used. If not, then it is preferable to ignore the camera calibration tags and use identity matrices instead in order to minimize the worst case calibration mismatch error.

This matching is done by comparing the CameraCalibrationSignature tag and the ProfileCalibrationSignature tag for the selected camera profile. If they match, then use the camera calibration tags. If not, then use identity matrices.

**One, Two, or Three Color Calibrations**

DNG provides for one, two, or three sets of color calibration tags, each set optimized for a different illuminant. If two or three sets of color calibration tags are included, then the raw converter should interpolate between the calibrations based on the white balance selected by the user.

Information for two calibrations

If exactly two calibrations are included, then it is recommended that one of the calibrations be for a low color temperature illuminant (e.g., Standard-A) and the second calibration illuminant be for a higher color temperature illuminant (e.g., D55 or D65). This combination has been found to work well for a wide range of real-world digital camera images.

DNG versions earlier than 1.2.0.0 allow the raw converter to choose the interpolation algorithm. DNG 1.2.0.0 and later requires a specific interpolation algorithm: linear interpolation using inverse correlated color temperature. To find the interpolation weighting factor between the two tag sets, find the correlated color temperature for the user-selected white balance and the two calibration illuminants. If the white balance temperature is between two calibration illuminant temperatures, then invert all the temperatures and use linear interpolation. Otherwise, use the closest calibration tag set.

Information for three calibrations

If three calibrations are included, then it is recommended that the first two calibrations are as described in the preceding paragraph, and the third calibration be used to characterize the "as shot" illuminant: that is, the illuminant used to photograph the main image. This third calibration provides a color transform optimized for the capture conditions, while providing additional calibrations for two other illuminants in case the user wishes to change the white balance significantly during raw conversion. Note that the 3rd calibration is introduced in DNG version 1.6.0.0.

Requirements for three calibrations

If CalibrationIlluminant3 is included, then the following are required:

* CalibrationIlluminant1 and CalibrationIlluminant2 must be included.  
* ColorMatrix3 must be included.  
* Either all three ForwardMatrix tags are included, or none of them are included.  
* Either all three ReductionMatrix tags are included, or none of them are included.  
* Either all three ProfileHueSatMapData tags are included, or none of them are included.  
* The white points (x-y chromaticity values) of all three calibration illuminants must be distinct.

**Definitions used in the following sections**

Let n be the dimensionality of the camera color space (usually 3 or 4).

Let CM be the n-by-3 matrix interpolated from the ColorMatrix1, ColorMatrix2, and ColorMatrix3 tags. Let CC be the n-by-n matrix interpolated from the CameraCalibration1, CameraCalibration2, and

CameraCalibration3 tags (or identity matrices, if the signatures donât match).

Let AB be the n-by-n matrix, which is zero except for the diagonal entries, which are defined by the AnalogBalance tag.

Let RM be the 3-by-n matrix interpolated from the ReductionMatrix1, ReductionMatrix2, and ReductionMatrix3 tags.

Let FM be the 3-by-n matrix interpolated from the ForwardMatrix1, ForwardMatrix2, and ForwardMatrix3 tags.

**Translating White Balance xy Coordinates to Camera Neutral Coordinates**

If the white balance is specified in terms of a CIE xy coordinate, then a camera neutral coordinate can be derived by first calculating the weighting factor between the two or three sets of color calibration tags.

The XYZ to camera space matrix is: XYZtoCamera \= AB \* CC \* CM

The camera neutral can be found by expanding the xy value to a 3-by-1 XYZ matrix (assuming Y \= 1.0) and multiplying it by the XYZtoCamera matrix:

CameraNeutral \= XYZtoCamera \* XYZ

**Translating Camera Neutral Coordinates to White Balance xy Coordinates**

This process is slightly more complex than the transform in the other direction because it requires an iterative solution.

1. Guess an xy value. Use that guess to find the interpolation weighting factor between the color calibration tags. Find the XYZtoCamera matrix as above.  
2. Find a new xy value by computing:  
   XYZ \= Inverse (XYZtoCamera) \* CameraNeutral  
   (If the XYZtoCamera matrix is not square, then use the pseudo inverse.)  
1. Convert the resulting XYZ to a new xy value.  
2. Iterate until the xy values converge to a solution.

**Camera to XYZ (D50) Transform**

DNG 1.2.0.0 and later support two methods of specifying the camera to XYZ (D50) transform, depending on whether or not the forward matrix tags are included in the camera profile.

The use of the forward matrix tags is recommended for two reasons. First, it allows the camera profile creator to control the chromatic adaptation algorithm used to convert between the calibration illuminant and D50. Second, it causes the white balance adjustment (if the user white balance does not match the calibration illuminant) to be done by scaling the camera coordinates rather than by adapting the resulting XYZ values, which has been found to work better in extreme cases.

**If the ForwardMatrix tags are not included in the camera profile**

1. First, invert the XYZ to Cameramatrix. If n \= 3, this is:

   CameraToXYZ \= Inverse (XYZtoCamera)

   If n \> 3, and the reduction matrix tags are included, then: CameraToXYZ \= Inverse (RM \* XYZtoCamera) \* RM

   Otherwise:

   CameraToXYZ \= PseudoInverse (XYZtoCamera)

1. The white balanced transform is computed: CameraToXYZ\_D50 \= CA \* CameraToXYZ  
   CA, above, is a chromatic adaptation matrix that maps from the white balance xy value to the D50 white point. The recommended method for computing this chromatic adaptation matrix is to use the linear Bradford algorithm.

**If the ForwardMatrix tags are included in the camera profile**

CameraToXYZ\_D50 \= FM \* D \* Inverse (AB \* CC)

D, above, is a diagonal n-by-n matrix, computed so that the CameraToXYZ\_D50 matrix maps the selected camera neutral to XYZ D50. The forward matrix is required to map a unit vector to XYZ D50 by definition, so D can be computed by finding the neutral for the reference camera:

ReferenceNeutral \= Inverse (AB \* CC) \* CameraNeutral And then:  
D \= Invert (AsDiagonalMatrix (ReferenceNeutral))

**Applying the Hue/Saturation/Value Mapping Table**

After the camera colors have been converted to XYZ (D50) values, the Hue/Saturation/Value mapping table, if any, is applied. If there are two or three Hue/Saturation/Value mapping tables, then they are interpolated in the same way that color calibration tags are interpolated. If only one Hue/Saturation/Value table is included, then it is used regardless of the selected white balance.

1. First, the XYZ (D50) values are converted to linear RGB coordinates, using the ProPhoto RGB primaries. (This is also known as RIMM space).  
2. If the camera profile is High Dynamic Range (see [ProfileDynamicRange](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark157%22)) and ValueDivisions is greater than 1, then apply the encoding function ð(ð¥) to each color component.  
3. The linear RGB coordinates are converted to HSV coordinates (Hue-Saturation-Value).  
4. The HSV coordinates are used to index the mapping table using tri-linear interpolation, resulting in three values: hue shift (in degrees); saturation scale factor; value scale factor. If the division count in a dimension is 1, then the table is constant for that dimension. If the camera profile is High Dynamic Range, the input value (V) coordinate is clamped to \[0, 1\] prior to indexing the mapping table.  
5. Hue is indexed using âwrap-aroundâ math. For example, if HueDivisions is equal to 3, then the table samples are at 0 degrees (red), 120 degrees (green), and 240 degrees (blue).  
6. The hue coordinate is modified by adding the hue shift.  
7. The saturation coordinate is modified by multiplying by the saturation scale factor, and then clipping to no more than 1.0.  
8. The value coordinate is modified by multiplying by the value scale factor. If the camera profile is Standard Dynamic Range, clip the result to no more than 1.0.  
9. The HSV coordinates are converted to linear RGB coordinates.  
10. If the camera profile is High Dynamic Range (see [ProfileDynamicRange](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark157%22)) and ValueDivisions is greater than 1, then applying decoding function ðâ1(ð¥) (inverse of the encoding function) to each color component.  
11. Convert from linear ProPhoto RGB back to XYZ (D50) values.

It is recommended that these tables be limited to use a ValueDivisions equal to 1, so the table is only indexed by hue and saturation. In this way, all colors with the same hue and saturation, but with different values, map to the same new hue and saturation while preserving their value ratios.

**Special compatibility note with DNG 1.2**

For maximum compatibility across DNG readers, it is recommended to use the first two calibration illuminants for standard illuminant types (such as A and D65) and to reserve the third illuminant for custom and "as shot" illuminants. DNG readers older than version 1.6 will be able to read and interpret the color

transforms (matrices and tables) from the first two illuminants. Newer DNG readers (DNG 1.6 and later) will be able to read and interpret the color transforms matrices and tables from all three illuminants.

Opcode List Processing

An opcode list is a list of opcodes, each of which does some specified image processing operation. Each opcode is performed in sequence.

Opcode lists are always stored in big-endian byte order, no matter what the fileâs main byte order is. This allows DNG utility programs to copy opcode lists from file to file, without needing to understand their detailed internal structure.

At the start of opcode list, there is a 32-bit unsigned integer count, which contains the number of opcodes in the list. This is followed by the data for each opcode.

Each opcode starts with a 32-bit unsigned integer, which contains the opcode ID. The opcode ID identifies the specific opcode. Documentation for each supported opcode ID in provided later in this chapter.

Next is a 32-bit unsigned integer, which contains the DNG specification version in which the opcode ID was defined. It is expected that new opcode IDs will be defined in future DNG specification versions. A DNG reader should never attempt to process an opcode with a version higher than DNG specification it was written to support.

Next is a 32-bit unsigned integer, which contains various flag bits. There are two defined flag bits. If bit 0 (the least significant bit) is set to 1, the opcode is considered optional, and the DNG reader may decide to not apply this opcode if it wishes, or it does not understand the opcode ID. If bit 1 (the second to least significant bit) is set to 1, the opcode can be skipped when doing âpreview qualityâ processing, and only needs to be applied when doing âfull qualityâ processing.

Next is a 32-bit unsigned integer, containing the number of bytes in a variable size parameter area for the opcode. The format of this variable size parameter area is dependent on the specific opcode ID, and is documented later in this chapter, along with each supported opcode ID.

When processing an opcode list, image values are clipped after the application of each opcode to the logical range of the image being modified. For OpcodeList1, this range is 0 to 232\-1 for images with a bit depth greater than 16, otherwise 0 to 216\-1. For OpcodeList2 and OpcodeList3, the logical range is 0.0 to 1.0.

As a special case, DNG readers should skip processing an opcode if both of the following conditions are met:

* it is a WarpRectilinear or WarpFisheye opcode, and  
* the opcode immediately follows (in the same opcode list) a WarpRectilinear2 opcode that is marked as Optional

This "skip rule" is intended to maximize compatibility across DNG readers. [See WarpRectilinear2](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark194%22) for more details.

The rest of this chapter contains information on each supported opcode ID.

Description

This opcode applies a warp to an image and can be used to correct geometric distortion and lateral (transverse) chromatic aberration for rectilinear lenses. The warp function supports both radial and tangential distortion correction.

Let ð¾ð \= {ðð0,ð, ðð1,ð, ðð2,ð, ðð3,ð, ðð¡0,ð, ðð¡1,ð} denote the ðth coefficient set, where ð â 1, 2, â¦ , ð. Parameter N is the number of coefficient sets. N must be 1 or the total number of image planes. If N \= 1, then a single set of warp coefficients (i.e., ð¾1) is applied to all image planes, i.e., all planes undergo the same transformation. If N

\> 1, coefficient set ð¾ð is used to process the ðth image plane, e.g., ð¾1 defines the warp function for the first image plane, ð¾2 defines the warp function for the second image plane, etc.

Parameters ð¾ð \= {ðð0,ð, ðð1,ð, ðð2,ð, ðð3,ð, ðð¡0,ð, ðð¡1,ð} are the radial and tangential coefficients that define the warp function for the ðth image plane; see below for implementation details and restrictions. Note that if

ðð0,ð \= 1 and the remaining terms are zero, then the warp function is the identity (i.e., no warp will be applied).

Parameters (ðÌð¥, ðÌð¦) are the normalized x- and y-coordinates of the optical center, relative to the top-left pixel of the image.

**Example 1**: specifying (0.5, 0.5) means that the optical center lies exactly at the image center. **Example 2**: specifying (1, 0\) means that the optical center lies at the top-right pixel of the image. Processing of this opcode is performed as follows.

Let ð¼â²(ð¥â², ð¦â²) be the pixel of the ðth plane of the original unwarped image at pixel position (ð¥â, ð¦â) â i.e., before opcode processing.

Let ð¼ð(ð¥, ð¦) be the pixel value of the ðth plane of the warped image at pixel position (ð¥, ð¦) â i.e., after opcode processing.

For each pixel (ð¥, ð¦) of the ðth plane of the warped image, compute:

ð¼ð(ð¥, ð¦) â     ð¼â²(ð¥â², ð¦â²)  
ððð ððððð	ð

i.e., the pixel at position (ð¥â², ð¦â²) in the original unwarped image is effectively moved to position (ð¥, ð¦) in the final warped image, where

ð¥â² \= ðð¥ \+ ð(Îð¥ð \+ Îð¥ð¡)

(Îð¥ð, Îð¦ð) and (Îð¥ð¡, Îð¦ð¡) are the radial and tangential warp components, respectively.

ð is the Euclidean distance (in pixels) from the optical center to the farthest pixel in the warped image.

ð is the normalized Euclidean distance (in \[0, 1\]) from the optical center to a given pixel in the warped image. It is recommended that implementations use a suitable resampling kernel, such as a cubic spline.

This opcode can be used to correct lateral (transverse) chromatic aberration by specifying the appropriate coefficients for each image plane separately.

Each coefficient set ð¾ð must satisfy the following constraints. Let (ð¥â², ð¦â²) \= ð¹(ð¥, ð¦) be the 2D warp function defined above. Let ð¥â² \= ð¹ð¥ (ð¥, ð¦) and ð¦â² \= ð¹ð¦(ð¥, ð¦) be the x-component and y-component of ð¹(ð¥, ð¦),

Description

This opcode applies a warp to an image and can be used to âunwrapâ an image captured with a fisheye lens and map it instead to a perspective projection. It can also be used to correct geometric distortion and lateral (transverse) chromatic aberration for both fisheye and rectilinear lenses.

Let ð¼ð(ð¥, ð¦) be the pixel value of the ðth plane of the warped image at pixel position (ð¥, ð¦) â i.e., after opcode processing.

Description

This opcode applies a gain function to an image and can be used to correct vignetting. Parameters (k0, k1, k2, k3, k4) define a radially-symmetric gain function, explained below. Note that if all ki terms are zero, then the gain function is the identity (i.e., no gain will be applied).

reciprocalRadial	LONG

Description

This opcode is an extension of the existing WarpRectilinear opcode introduced in DNG 1.3. The goal is to support the correction of more complex (higher-order) distortion. The changes are:

1. Additional radial polynomial terms. The original WarpRectilinear opcode supports radial distortion as a sum of even-power radial terms, up to ð6 order. This opcode supports both odd- and even- power radial terms up to ð14 order.  
2. An option to apply the radial distortion model using division.  
3. An option to specify a valid radius range for the radial polynomial model. In this opcode, the radial distortion term ð is computed as:

14

ð(ð) \= â (ðð	â ðð)

ð=0

If the reciprocalRadial parameter is 0, then the definition of the radial distortion term is:

ððððð \= ðððððð â ð(clamp(ðððððð , min\_valid\_radius, max\_valid\_radius))

If the reciprocalRadial parameter is a non-zero value, then the definition of the radial distortion term is:

	ðððððð	  
ð	\=

ðððð	ð(clamp(ð	, min\_valid\_radius, max\_valid\_radius))  
ððððð

The **min\_valid\_radius** and **max\_valid\_radius** parameters define a valid range for the radial polynomial function ð. This may be useful if optimizing a warp function to match another lens's field of view.

Additional details:

* The above function ð must be one-to-one for values of ðððððð in the range \[min\_valid\_radius, max\_valid\_radius\].  
* When ðððððð \< min\_valid\_radius, then the input to ð is clamped to min\_valid\_radius; see the above definition of the radial distortion term.  
* When ðððððð \> max\_valid\_radius, then the input to ð is clamped to max\_valid\_radius; see the above definition of the radial distortion term.  
* For normal use cases (where the radial distortion model is valid over the entire recorded image area), set min\_valid\_radius to 0.0 and max\_valid\_radius to 1.0.  
* These parameters must satisfy the inequalities: 0.0 â¤ min\_valid\_radius \< max\_valid\_radius â¤ 1.0. The meaning of the other parameters is the same as WarpRectilinear.

Special Compatibility Note and Relationship to Previous Warp Opcodes

This section describes a modification to the normal DNG opcode processing model. This modification is intended to maximize warp support and compatibility across DNG readers. The idea is that a DNG opcode list can use two warp opcodes: a more accurate opcode (WarpRectilinear2) intended for DNG 1.6 and later readers, and a baseline opcode (either WarpRectilinear or WarpFisheye) for earlier DNG readers.

Normally, a DNG reader applies all the opcodes in an opcode list in sequence from front to back. However, if the reader processes a WarpRectilinear2 opcode that is marked **optional** (using the opcode flag bits), then the reader should skip the next opcode in the list if it's a WarpRectilinear or WarpFisheye opcode. This "skip" rule applies only to the opcode immediately following the WarpRectilinear2 opcode, if any, in the same opcode list.

**Example 1: Opcode list 3 contains the following opcodes.**

1. WarpRectilinear2  
2. GainMap

Result: The reader should apply both opcodes, in order. The opcode following WarpRectilinear2 is neither WarpRectilinear nor WarpFisheye, so it is applied normally.

**Example 2: Opcode list 3 contains the following opcodes:**

1. WarpRectilinear2, marked optional  
2. WarpFisheye  
3. GainMap

Result: The reader should apply the WarpRectilinear2 opcode, then the GainMap opcode. The WarpFisheye opcode is skipped, per the skip rule.

**Example 3: Opcode list 3 contains the following opcodes:**

1. WarpRectilinear2, marked optional  
2. GainMap  
3. WarpRectilinear

Result: The reader should apply all three opcodes, in order. Although there is a WarpRectilinear opcode later in the list, it does not immediately follow WarpRectilinear2, so the skip rule does not apply.

Appendix A: Compatibility With Previous Versions

This appendix documents only the differences between this and previous versions of the DNG specification that are relevant to compatibility. Differences that are not relevant to compatibility (e.g., new optional tags that DNG readers are not required to support) are not documented in this appendix.

This information is useful in enabling DNG readers to correctly read DNG files with older version numbers. It also helps determine what version DNG writers can include in the DNGBackwardVersion tag.

The first version of the DNG speciation that was published was version 1.0.0.0.

**Compatibility Issue 1: ActiveArea Tag**

The ActiveArea tag was added to the DNG specification in version 1.1.0.0. Previous versions of the DNG specification do not support storing masked pixels.

DNG writers should set the DNGBackwardVersion to a minimum of 1.1.0.0 if the masked pixels are stored in the DNG file.

**Compatibility Issue 2: 16-bit Lossless JPEG Encoding**

The Lossless JPEG encoder/decoder used by Adobe applications to read and write DNG files before version

1.1.0.0 incorrectly deviated from the JPEG specification when dealing with 16- bit data. Since both the encoder and decoder deviated in the same way, no data was lost; however the data stream did not exactly match the data stream specified in the Lossless JPEG specification.

Because the vast majority of DNG 1.0.0.0 files using 16-bit Lossless JPEG encoding were created by Adobe applications, it is strongly recommended that software that reads or writes DNG files with version numbers less than 1.1.0.0 incorporate this deviation. Software that reads or writes DNG files with version 1.1.0.0 or later can safely assume that the Lossless JPEG stream is fully compliant with the Lossless JPEG specification.

Description of deviation

Lossless JPEG encodes the difference between a predicted value and the actual value for each pixel. With 16- bit data, these differences are computed modulo 16-bits, so the range of possible differences is \-32768 to \+ 32767\. Two values are stored for the difference. First the number of bits required to store the difference (encoded via a Huffman code), and then the actual difference.

Using the difference encoding scheme in the Lossless JPEG specification, only one difference value would take 16-bits to store: \-32768. The Lossless JPEG specification special cases this difference bit length, and since there is only one possible difference value it does not bother to use any bits to store the actual difference.

In earlier versions of DNG the special case logic is not present, and the difference value for \- 32768 is stored in the compressed data stream as with all other difference bit lengths.

**Compatibility Issue 3: SubTileBlockSize**

The SubTileBlockSize tag was added to the DNG specification in version 1.2.0.0. Earlier versions of the DNG specification did not support this feature.

DNG writers should set the DNGBackwardVersion tag to a minimum of 1.2.0.0 if non-default values are used for this tag.

**Compatibility Issue 4: RowInterleaveFactor**

The RowInterleaveFactor tag was added to the DNG specification in version 1.2.0.0. Earlier versions of the DNG specification did not support this feature.

DNG writers should set the DNGBackwardVersion tag to a minimum of 1.2.0.0 if non-default values are used for this tag.

**Compatibility Issue 5: PreviewColorSpace**

The PreviewColorSpace tag was added to the DNG specification in version 1.2.0.0. Earlier versions of the DNG specification did not support this feature.

DNG writers should set the DNGBackwardVersion tag to a minimum of 1.2.0.0 if non-default values are used for this tag.

**Compatibility Issue 6: CFALayout**

CFALayout values 6 through 9 were added to the DNG specification in version 1.3.0.0. Earlier versions of the DNG specification did not support these CFALayout values.

DNG writers should set the DNGBackwardVersion tag to a minimum of 1.3.0.0 if CFALayout values 6 through 9 are used.

**Compatibility Issue 7: Opcode Lists**

The OpcodeList1, OpcodeList2, and OpcodeList3 tags, plus the initial set of supported Opcode IDs, were added to the DNG specification in version 1.3.0.0.

DNG writers should not set the DNGBackwardVersion to a version less than the DNG version for any opcode that is not marked optional.

**Compatibility Issue 8: Floating Point Image Data**

Support for floating point image data was added in DNG Version 1.4.0.0.

DNG writers should set the DNGBackwardVersion tag to a minimum of 1.4.0.0 if the main image IFD uses floating point data.

**Compatibility Issue 9: Transparent Pixels**

Support for transparent pixels was added in DNG Version 1.4.0.0.

DNG writers should set the DNGBackwardVersion tag to a minimum of 1.4.0.0 if the DNG file contains an IFD with NewSubFileType equal to 4\.

**Compatibility Issue 10: Deflate Compression**

Support for compression code 8 (Deflate) was added in DNG Version 1.4.0.0.

**Compatibility Issue 11: Lossy JPEG Compression**

Support for compression code 34892 (Lossy JPEG) was added in DNG Version 1.4.0.0.

DNG writers should set the DNGBackwardVersion tag to a minimum of 1.4.0.0 if the main image IFD uses compression code 34892\.

**Compatibility Issue 12: Depth Maps**

Support for depth maps was added in DNG Version 1.5.0.0, but since reading the depth map is optional, writers should not increase the DNGBackwardVersion tag higher than otherwise required.

**Compatibility Issue 13: Enhanced Image Data**

Support for enhanced image data was added in DNG Version 1.5.0.0, but since reading the enhanced image data is optional, writers should not increase the DNGBackwardVersion tag higher than otherwise required.

**Compatibility Issue 14: Semantic Mask**

Support for semantic masks was added in DNG Version 1.6.0.0, but since reading the semantic mask is optional, writers should not increase the DNGBackwardVersion tag higher than otherwise required.

**Compatibility Issue 15: ProfileGainTableMap**

Support for ProfileGainTableMap was added in DNG Version 1.6.0.0, but since reading and applying the ProfileGainTableMap is optional, writers should not increase the DNGBackwardVersion tag higher than otherwise required.

**Compatibility Issue 16: WarpRectilinear2 Opcode**

Support for the WarpRectilinear2 opcode was added in DNG Version 1.6.0.0. DNG writers should set the DNGBackwardVersion as described in Compatibility Issue 7: Opcode Lists. Namely, if a DNG writer includes a WarpRectilinear2 opcode that is marked as required, then the DNGBackwardVersion tag must be set to at least 1.6.0.0. Also see the description of WarpRectilinear2 in Chapter 7 for a method of combining WarpRectilinear2 with WarpRectilinear or WarpFisheye to maximize compatibility across DNG readers.

**Compatibility Issue 17: Third Color Calibration and Custom Illuminant Data**

Support for a third color calibration was added in DNG Version 1.6.0.0. To maximize compatibility across readers, a DNG writer is required to set the DNGBackwardVersion tag to at least 1.6.0.0 only if at least one of the following conditions is met:

* CalibrationIlluminant1 tag is present and set to 255  
* CalibrationIlluminant2 tag is present and set to 255

**Compatibility Issue 18: JPEG XL Compression**

Support for compression code 52546 (JPEG XL) was added in DNG Version 1.7.0.0.

DNG writers should set the DNGBackwardVersion tag to a minimum of 1.7.0.0 if the main image IFD uses compression code 52546\.

**Compatibility Issue 19: ColumnInterleaveFactor**

The [ColumnInterleaveFactor](http://%5Cl%20%22bookmark155%22) tag was added to the DNG specification in version 1.7.1.0. Earlier versions of the DNG specification did not support this feature.

DNG writers should set the DNGBackwardVersion tag to a minimum of 1.7.1.0 if non-default values are used for this tag.

**Compatibility Issue 20: ProfileGainTableMap and Camera Profile IFD**

Support for ProfileGainTableMap in Camera Profile IFD was added in DNG Version 1.7.0.0, but since reading and applying the ProfileGainTableMap is optional, writers should not increase the DNGBackwardVersion tag higher than otherwise required.
